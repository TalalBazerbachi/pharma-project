                <p>MabThera infusions should be administered in a medical environment in which the<br />resources for effective resuscitation can be immediately deployed. The infusions should be<br />administered under the direct supervision of a physician experienced in the respective<br />specialty. MabThera can be administered on an ambulant basis. Patients who develop<br />respiratory symptoms or hypotension should be monitored for at least 24 hours.<br />First infusion: The recommended initial infusion rate is 50 mg/h; after the first 60 minutes<br />the rate can be escalated in 50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of<br />400 mg/h.</p><p>Subsequent infusions: Subsequent infusions of MabThera can be started at a rate of<br />100 mg/h and increased by 100 mg/h increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of<br />400 mg/h.<br />Patients should be closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome (see<br />Warnings and precautions). In patients who develop evidence of severe adverse drug<br />reactions (ADRs), especially severe dyspnea, bronchospasm or hypoxia, the infusion<br />should be interrupted immediately. Patients with follicular non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma,<br />DLBCL or CLL should also be evaluated for evidence of tumour lysis syndrome. Patients<br />with pre-existing respiratory failure or pulmonary tumour infiltration must undergo a chest<br />X-ray. In all patients the infusion should not be restarted until all clinical signs and<br />symptoms have fully resolved and laboratory values have returned to normal, at which<br />point the infusion can be resumed at up to half the previous rate. If the same severe adverse<br />drug reactions recur, consideration should be given to stopping the treatment.<br />Non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma (NHL)<br />Glucocorticoid premedication is not generally required because MabThera is combined in<br />this context with glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy such as CHOP or CVP.<br />Reducing the dose of MabThera is not recommended (except in CLL).<br />Follicular non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma</p><p>Premedication consisting of an analgesic/antipyretic (e.g. paracetamol) and an anti-<br />histaminic drug (e.g. diphenhydramine) should always be administered before each</p><p>infusion of MabThera/Rituxan (30 to 60 minutes before the start of the infusion).<br />Premedication with glucocorticoids should also be considered, particularly if<br />MabThera/Rituxan is not given in combination with steroid-containing chemotherapy.<br />Monotherapy: The recommended dosage is 375 mg/m2</p><p>body surface area weekly for</p><p>4 weeks as an intravenous infusion.<br />Combination therapy: The recommended dosage of MabThera in combination with CVP<br />or CHOP chemotherapy is 375 mg/m2</p><p>body surface area once per cycle for 8 treatment<br />cycles. The dose of MabThera is given on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle after oral<br />administration of the glucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy.<br />Maintenance therapy<br />In untreated patients MabThera is administered every 2 months (375 mg/m2</p><p>body surface</p><p>area).<br />In the treatment of recurrence MabThera is administered every 3 months (375 mg/m2<br />body</p><p>surface area).<br />The maintenance dose should be given until disease progression or for a maximum<br />duration of two years.</p><p>Diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma</p><p>Premedication consisting of an analgesic/antipyretic (e.g. paracetamol) and an anti-<br />histaminic drug (e.g. diphenhydramine) should always be administered before each</p><p>infusion of MabThera/Rituxan (30 to 60 minutes before the start of the infusion).<br />Premedication with glucocorticoids should also be considered, particularly if<br />MabThera/Rituxan is not given in combination with steroid-containing chemotherapy.<br />MabThera should be used in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. The recommended<br />dosage of MabThera is 375 mg/m2</p><p>body surface area once every 3 weeks for 8 treatment<br />cycles. The dose of MabThera is administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle after<br />i.v. administration of the glucocorticoid component of the CHOP chemotherapy.<br />Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)<br />It is recommended that 48 hours before the start of treatment prophylaxis with adequate<br />fluid intake and administration of urostatic agents be initiated in order to reduce the risk of<br />tumour lysis syndrome.<br />In addition, consideration should be given to premedication with glucocorticoids shortly<br />before the start of the infusion with MabThera in order to reduce the frequency and<br />severity of acute infusion reactions and/or of cytokine release syndrome.<br />The recommended dose of MabThera in previously untreated or relapsed/refractory<br />patients is 375 mg/m2</p><p>body surface area on day 1 of the first treatment cycle, followed by</p><p>500 mg/m2</p><p>body surface area on day 1 of cycles 2&ndash;6 (at four-week intervals).

This results in a dose equivalent to 50% of the normal<br />fludarabine/cyclophosphamide dose.</p><p>Rheumatoid arthritis</p><p>Premedication consisting of an analgesic/antipyretic (e.g. paracetamol) and an anti-<br />histaminic drug (e.g. diphenhydramine) should always be administered before each</p><p>infusion of MabThera/Rituxan (30 to 60 minutes before the start of the infusion).<br />Premedication with glucocorticoids should also be administered in order to reduce the<br />frequency and severity of infusion-related reactions. Patients should receive 100 mg i.v.<br />methylprednisolone to be completed 30 minutes prior to each MabThera/Rituxan infusion.</p><p>A treatment cycle with MabThera consists of two i.v. infusions of 1,000 mg given at an<br />interval of 2 weeks. Depending on the course of the disease, additional treatment cycles<br />can be given.<br />After the infusion has been completed, the intravenous line should be left in place for at<br />least one hour so that if necessary drugs can be administered intravenously. If no<br />undesirable effects occur during this period, the intravenous line can then be removed.<br />In a dose-finding study in a less treatment-resistant patient population that had failed to<br />respond to treatment with DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), treatment<br />with 2 &times; 500 mg per cycle proved similarly effective as 2 &times; 1,000 mg (in terms of the<br />endpoint ACR 20). Doses of less than 2 &times; 500 mg per cycle were not investigated.<br />The requirement for further cycles should be assessed 24 weeks after the previous cycle on<br />the basis of residual or recurrent disease activity. Retreatment should be given if residual<br />disease activity exceeds a DAS28-ESR score of 2.6. If the DAS28-ESR score is less than<br />2.6, retreatment should be given as soon as disease activity increases again (to DAS28-<br />ESR &gt;2.6).<br />Treatment with MabThera should only be continued in patients whose DAS28-ESR score<br />has decreased by at least 1.2 units after two treatment cycles.<br />In patients previously treated with TNF inhibitors, treatment with etanercept must have<br />been discontinued for at least 4 weeks, and with infliximab or adalimumab for at least 8<br />weeks, before starting MabThera treatment.<br />The use of MabThera is not recommended in MTX-naive patients since a favourable<br />benefit-risk ratio has not been demonstrated.</p><p>ANCA-associated vasculitis<br />Treatment should only be conducted by physicians experienced in the treatment of<br />rheumatic and immunological diseases.<br />Before each MabThera infusion (30 to 60 minutes before starting the infusion)<br />premedication must always be administered with an analgesic/antipyretic (e.g.<br />paracetamol) and an antihistamine (e.g. diphenhydramine).<br />The recommended dosage of MabThera for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis is<br />375 mg/m2</p><p>body surface area administered once weekly as an intravenous infusion for</p><p>4 weeks.<br />For the treatment of severe vasculitis symptoms it is recommended that MabThera be<br />combined with intravenous methylprednisolone 1,000 mg daily for 1 to 3 days, followed<br />by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg body weight/day (not to exceed 80 mg/day and to be tapered as<br />rapidly as possible according to clinical need) during and after treatment with MabThera.First infusion: The recommended initial infusion rate of MabThera is 50 mg/h; it may<br />subsequently be increased in 50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of<br />400 mg/h.<br />Subsequent infusions: Subsequent MabThera infusions may be started at an infusion rate of<br />100 mg/h and increased in 100 mg/h increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of<br />400 mg/h.<br />The safety and efficacy of treatment with subsequent cycles of MabThera have not been<br />determined.<br />In patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP)<br />prophylaxis is recommended as needed during and after MabThera treatment.<br />Special dosage instructions<br />Use in children and adolescents<br />The use and safety of MabThera in children and adolescents have not been investigated.<br />Elderly patients<br />No dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients (&gt;65 years).<br />Patients with hepatic or renal impairment<br />No experience is available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.</p>

                <p>In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename MabThera<br />should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. Replacement by another biological<br />medicinal product requires the prescriber&rsquo;s consent. The data in this prescribing<br />information apply only to MabThera.<br />Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy<br />Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported during or<br />after the use of MabThera. Two cases of fatal PML in NHL patients were also observed in<br />a clinical phase III study after disease progression and retreatment. The majority of patients<br />had received MabThera in combination with chemotherapy or in a context of&nbsp;</p><p>hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the differential diagnosis of patients developing<br />neurological symptoms the possibility of PML must be considered.<br />Patients should be monitored at regular intervals for emergent or worsening symptoms<br />indicative of PML. PML is frequently fatal and resistant to all therapy. PML signs and<br />symptoms are varied, progress over days to weeks and may comprise increasing weakness<br />in one side of the body or clumsiness in the limbs, loss of balance, visual disturbances and<br />impairment of cognition, memory and orientation, leading to confusion and personality<br />changes.<br />If in doubt, further investigations should be considered, including MRI (preferably<br />contrast-enhanced), testing of the cerebrospinal fluid for JC virus DNA and serial<br />neurological assessment. The physician should be alert to signs and symptoms indicative<br />of PML, in particular those unnoticed by the patient (e.g. cognitive, neurological or<br />psychiatric signs). The patient should in addition be advised to inform their partner or<br />carers about their treatment since these may observe signs that escape the patient&rsquo;s notice.<br />If PML is suspected, prompt neurological workup is indicated and treatment should be<br />suspended until PML is excluded. If PML is confirmed, MabThera must be permanently<br />withdrawn.<br />Following reconstitution of the immune system, stabilisation or improvement has been<br />observed in immunosuppressed patients with PML. It is not known whether early detection<br />of PML and suspension of MabThera treatment could lead to similar stabilisation or<br />improvement.</p><p>Patients with hematological malignancies<br />Tumour lysis syndrome: MabThera brings about rapid lysis of benign and malignant<br />CD20-positive cells and can precipitate tumour lysis syndrome with hyperuricemia,<br />hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, elevated LDH levels and acute renal<br />failure. Patients with a high number (&gt;25,000/mm3</p><p>) of circulating malignant cells or a high<br />tumour burden (lesions &gt;10 cm) are at higher risk of tumour lysis syndrome and should be<br />treated with extreme caution. In patients at risk for the development of tumour lysis<br />syndrome the need for appropriate prophylaxis should be considered. In these patients the<br />infusion rate should be reduced or infusion spread over 2 days in the first cycle, and in all<br />subsequent cycles if the lymphocyte count remains above 25,000/mm3</p><p>. The patients should</p><p>be monitored particularly closely during administration of the first infusion.<br />Infusion-related reactions</p><p>Treatment with MabThera leads to release of cytokines and is associated with infusion-<br />related reactions, especially after administration of the first dose. The incidence of</p><p>infusion-related reactions decreased from 77% (7% grade 3/4) with the first infusion to<br />approximately 30% (2% grade 3/4) with the fourth infusion and to 14% (no grade 3/4&nbsp;</p><p>events) with the eighth infusion. Severe infusion-related reactions may be clinically<br />indistinguishable from hypersensitivity reactions or cytokine release syndrome. Severe<br />infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported. Severe infusion-related<br />reactions, which are characterised by pulmonary events, generally commence within<br />30 minutes to two hours after the start of the first MabThera infusion and in some cases<br />have also included rapid tumour lysis and signs of tumour lysis syndrome as well as fever,<br />chills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other signs and symptoms (see<br />Undesirable effects).<br />It is recommended that infusion-related reactions be treated with diphenhydramine and<br />acetaminophen. Additional treatment with bronchodilators or intravenous saline solution<br />may be indicated. In most cases the infusion can be continued with a 50% reduction of<br />infusion rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) after complete resolution of signs and<br />symptoms. Most patients other than those with life-threatening infusion-related reactions<br />were able to complete the treatment cycle with MabThera. Only rarely have severe<br />infusion-related reactions recurred during subsequent treatment of patients whose signs and<br />symptoms have resolved completely.<br />The occurrence of anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions has been reported after<br />intravenous administration of proteins to patients. Adrenaline, antihistamines and<br />glucocorticoids should be available for immediate use in the event of a hypersensitivity<br />reaction during administration of MabThera.<br />Pulmonary events<br />Pulmonary events including hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates and acute respiratory failure<br />have occurred. Many of these events were preceded by severe bronchospasm and dyspnea.<br />In some cases the signs and symptoms worsened, while in other cases an initial<br />improvement was followed by a clinical deterioration. Patients with pulmonary events or<br />other severe infusion reactions must therefore be closely monitored until their signs and<br />symptoms have resolved completely. Patients with a history of respiratory failure or with<br />pulmonary tumour infiltration are at greater risk of an unfavourable outcome and should<br />therefore be treated with greater caution. Acute respiratory failure can be accompanied by<br />events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration visible on a chest radiograph and edema.<br />The syndrome generally appears within one to two hours after the start of the first infusion.<br />In patients with severe pulmonary events the infusion must be stopped immediately and<br />symptomatic therapy initiated.<br />Cardiovascular<br />Since transient hypotension may occur during MabThera infusion, consideration should be<br />given to withholding antihypertensive medications 12 hours prior to and throughout</p><p>MabThera infusion. When MabThera was administered, cases were observed in which pre-<br />existing ischemic heart disease became manifest and caused symptoms such as angina</p><p>pectoris, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Patients with a history of<br />heart disease (e.g. angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter or fibrillation,</p><p>heart failure or myocardial infarction) should be closely monitored during the infusion.<br />Patients with severe heart failure (NYHA class IV) should not be treated.<br />Monitoring of blood counts<br />Caution should be exercised when treating patients with neutrophil counts of &lt;1.5 &times; 109<br />/l</p><p>and/or platelet counts of &lt;75 &times; 109</p><p>/l, as clinical experience with such patients is limited.<br />As with other tumour therapies, regular monitoring of full blood count, including platelet<br />count, is indicated.<br />Immunisation<br />The safety of immunisation with vaccines, especially live vaccines, following MabThera<br />therapy has not been studied, nor whether a primary humoral response to vaccines is<br />possible.<br />Patients treated with MabThera must not receive live vaccines. If necessary, they may be<br />immunised with non-live vaccines, although a reduced response rate must be expected. In a<br />non-randomised study, patients receiving MabThera monotherapy had a lower response<br />rate (when assessed for a &gt;2-fold increase in antibody titre) to testing with tetanus recall<br />antigen (16% vs 81%) and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH; 4% vs 76%), compared to<br />untreated controls.<br />Mean pretherapeutic antibody titres against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus<br />pneumoniae, influenza A, mumps, rubella, varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months<br />after treatment with MabThera.<br />Skin reactions<br />Severe mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in isolated<br />patients treated with MabThera. These reactions occurred between 1 and 13 weeks after the<br />start of treatment. Affected patients should receive no further infusions and must undergo a<br />medical examination immediately. A skin biopsy is useful for distinguishing between<br />different skin reactions and determining subsequent treatment. The mucocutaneous<br />reactions reported included paraneoplastic pemphigus, lichenoid dermatitis and<br />vesiculobullous dermatitis. Nothing is known regarding the safety of retreatment with<br />MabThera in these cases.<br />Serious skin reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome,<br />some of which were fatal, have been reported (see Undesirable effects). In such an event<br />treatment should be discontinued and only reintroduced after careful consideration of the<br />patient&rsquo;s individual benefit-risk profile.<br />Serious viral infections<br />Patients with serious viral infections should not be treated with MabThera. Serious viral<br />infections, both new and reactivated or exacerbated, have been reported on treatment with<br />rituximab and have been fatal in isolated cases. The majority of patients had received<br />rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or in the context of hematopoietic stem cell<br />transplantation. Examples of such serious viral infections include infections with&nbsp;herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus), JC virus<br />(progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]) and hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus.<br />Cases of hepatitis B reactivation &ndash; including fulminant hepatitis, sometimes with fatal<br />outcome &ndash; have been reported; the majority of affected patients were also receiving<br />cytotoxic chemotherapy. Causality cannot be clearly distinguished.<br />Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening according to local guidelines should be performed in all<br />patients before initiation of treatment with MabThera. Patients with active hepatitis B disease<br />should not be treated with MabThera. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology should consult a<br />liver disease specialist before the start of treatment and should be monitored and managed<br />according to usual local standard medical practice to prevent hepatitis B reactivation..<br />Gastrointestinal tract<br />Gastrointestinal perforation or obstruction, in a few cases leading to death, has been<br />observed in patients who received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy for the<br />treatment of non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma. Complaints of abdominal pain, especially at the<br />start of treatment, should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate<br />treatment.<br />Nervous system disorders<br />There have been post-marketing reports of cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy<br />syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). Signs and<br />symptoms included visual disturbances, headaches, seizures and altered mental state with<br />or without associated hypertension. The diagnosis of PRES/RPLS must be confirmed by<br />brain imaging. In the reported cases there were recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS<br />including patients&rsquo; underlying disease, hypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or<br />chemotherapy.<br />Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ANCA-associated vasculitis<br />The efficacy and safety of MabThera for the treatment of autoimmune diseases other than<br />rheumatoid arthritis and ANCA-associated vasculitis have not been studied.<br />An electrocardiogram should be performed before starting treatment of ANCA-associated<br />vasculitis.<br />Infusion-related reactions<br />Administration of MabThera can be associated with infusion reactions related to release of<br />cytokines and/or other chemical mediators. Signs and symptoms that indicate an infusion<br />reaction are headache, itch, fever, urticaria/rash, chills, pyrexia, sneezing, angioneurotic<br />edema, throat irritation, cough and bronchospasm &ndash; with or without associated hypotension<br />or hypertension. Premedication consisting of an analgesic/antipyretic drug and an<br />antihistaminic drug should always be administered before each infusion of<br />MabThera/Rituxan. For RA patients, premedication with glucocorticoids should also be<br />administered before each infusion of MabThera/Rituxan, in order to reduce the frequency&nbsp;</p><p>and severity of infusion-related reactions (see Dosage and administration). Higher doses of<br />intravenous glucocorticoids were administered in ANCA-associated vasculitis patients.<br />For RA patients, most infusion-related events reported in clinical trials were mild to<br />moderate in severity. In clinical studies a severe infusion reaction occurred, independently<br />of dose, in 14 of 3,095 patients (&lt;1%) with rheumatoid arthritis who received a first<br />infusion of MabThera. Severe infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been<br />reported in the post-marketing setting (in total approx. 150,000 treated RA patients).<br />Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions and those who experienced prior<br />cardiopulmonary adverse reactions should be closely monitored.<br />In general, the proportion of patients experiencing an infusion reaction was higher after the<br />first infusion of a cycle than after the second infusion. Subsequent MabThera cycles were<br />better tolerated by patients than the first cycle.<br />The reported reactions were generally reversible when the infusion of MabThera was<br />administered more slowly or interrupted and an antipyretic, an antihistamine and &ndash; in<br />isolated cases and if required &ndash; oxygen, i.v. saline solution or bronchodilators and<br />glucocorticoids were administered. Depending on the severity of the infusion-related<br />reaction and the required interventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue<br />MabThera/Rituxan. In most cases the infusion can be continued with a 50% reduction of<br />infusion rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) after complete resolution of signs and<br />symptoms.<br />Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported at the start of, during<br />and after i.v. administration of proteins to patients. Drugs for the treatment of<br />hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. adrenaline, antihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be<br />available for immediate use in the event that an allergic reaction occurs during<br />administration of MabThera.<br />Infusion reactions in ANCA-associated vasculitis patients were comparable to those<br />observed in RA patients.<br />No data are available on the safety of MabThera in patients with moderately severe heart<br />failure (NYHA class III). Cases of angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial<br />flutter and fibrillation, heart failure or myocardial infarction have been observed on<br />treatment with MabThera. Therefore, in patients with a history of heart disease the risk for<br />cardiovascular complications due to infusion-related reactions should be considered before<br />treatment with MabThera is initiated, and such patients should be closely monitored during<br />administration of MabThera. Patients with severe heart failure (NYHA class IV) should<br />not be treated.<br />Since hypotension can occur during infusion of MabThera, consideration should be given<br />to withholding blood-pressure-lowering medications in the 12 hours preceding infusion of<br />MabThera.<br />Infections</p><p>The risk of infection is potentially increased after treatment with MabThera (see Contra-<br />indications). MabThera should not be administered to patients with active infection or&nbsp;severely impaired immune response (e.g. hypogammaglobulinemia, severely reduced CD4<br />or CD8 cell counts). Caution is required when MabThera is prescribed for patients with a<br />history of recurrent or chronic infection or an underlying disease that favours the<br />occurrence of severe infections (see Undesirable effects). Patients who develop an<br />infection after treatment with MabThera should be promptly investigated and appropriately<br />treated.<br />Hepatitis B infections<br />Cases of reactivation of hepatitis B infection, including some with fatal outcome, have<br />been reported in RA and AAV patients receiving MabThera.<br />Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening according to local guidelines should be performed in all<br />patients before initiation of treatment with MabThera. Patients with active hepatitis B<br />disease should not be treated with MabThera. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology should<br />consult a liver disease specialist before the start of treatment and should be monitored and<br />managed according to usual local standard medical practice to prevent hepatitis B<br />reactivation.<br />Skin reactions<br />Serious skin reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome,<br />some of which were fatal, have been reported (see Undesirable effects). In such an event<br />treatment should be discontinued and only reintroduced after careful consideration of the<br />patient&rsquo;s individual benefit-risk profile.<br />Immunisation<br />In RA patients the physician should review vaccination status and follow local/national<br />immunisation guidelines for adults against infectious diseases prior to treatment with<br />MabThera. Vaccination should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to first administration<br />of MabThera.<br />Vaccination with live viral vaccines should not be performed during treatment with<br />MabThera.<br />Response to inactivated vaccines may be reduced during and after treatment with<br />MabThera. Comparison of patients treated with either MabThera and methotrexate or<br />methotrexate alone showed similar response rates to tetanus recall antigen (39% vs 42%)<br />and decreased response rates to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (43% vs 82%)<br />6 months after completing MabThera treatment.<br />In repeat treatment over one year the proportion of patients with positive antibody titres<br />against S. pneumoniae, influenza, mumps, rubella, varicella and tetanus toxoid were<br />generally similar to the proportions at baseline.<br />Further warnings and precautions&nbsp;The efficacy and safety of MabThera in the treatment of autoimmune diseases other than<br />rheumatoid arthritis have not been investigated.<br />No data are available for patients with severe pulmonary disease. Caution should therefore<br />be exercised when MabThera is used in these patients.<br />No data are available for patients with anemia (Hb &lt;8.5 g/dl) or neutropenia (neutrophil<br />count &lt;1,500/&mu;l).</p>

            <div class="ltr">
                <p>ATC code: L01XC02<br />Mechanism of action<br />Rituximab is a chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the</p><p>transmembrane antigen CD20. This antigen is located on pre-B- and mature B-<br />lymphocytes, but not on hemopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other</p><p>normal tissue. The antigen is expressed on &gt;95% of all cells of B-cell non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s<br />lymphomas (NHLs). Following antibody binding, CD20 is not internalised or shed from<br />the cell membrane into the environment. CD20 does not circulate in the plasma as a free</p><p>antigen and thus does not compete for antibody binding. Studies conducted to date have<br />shown no connection between the intensity of CD20 expression on malignant cells and<br />therapeutic response.<br />Rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B-lymphocytes and causes B-cell lysis. Possible</p><p>mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-<br />dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and induction of apoptosis.</p><p>Peripheral B-cell counts declined below normal following the first dose of MabThera. In<br />patients treated for hematological malignancies, B-cell recovery began within 6 months of<br />completing therapy and generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after the end<br />of treatment. In rheumatoid arthritis patients, the duration of B-cell depletion was variable.<br />The majority of patients received a further treatment before complete B-cell repletion. In<br />ANCA-associated vasculitis patients, peripheral blood CD19 B-cells declined after the first<br />two infusions of rituximab to below 10 cells/&mu;l and remained at this level in most patients<br />for up to 6 months.<br />Of 67 patients tested for human antimouse antibody (HAMA), none proved positive. Of<br />356 patients with non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma tested for human antichimeric antibody<br />(HACA), 4 (1.1%) proved positive.<br />Of 1,039 patients with rheumatoid arthritis tested for human antichimeric antibodies<br />(HACA), 96 (9.2%) proved positive. The occurrence of HACA in these patients was not<br />associated with any clinical deterioration or with an increased risk for reactions to<br />subsequent infusions.<br />Out of 99 ANCA-associated vasculitis patients treated with rituximab, a total of 23 (23%)<br />were HACA-positive after 18 months. The clinical relevance of HACA development in<br />patients treated with rituximab is unclear.<br />Finally, in vitro studies have demonstrated that rituximab sensitises drug-resistant human<br />B-cell lymphoma lines to the cytotoxic effects of some chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p>Clinical efficacy<br />Non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma<br />Monotherapy</p><p>In the pivotal study, 166 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low-grade or follicular B-<br />cell NHL received 375 mg/m2</p><p>of MabThera as an intravenous infusion once weekly for 4<br />weeks. The overall response rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 48%<br />(95% confidence interval [CI95%] 41%&ndash;56%) with a 6% complete response (CR) and a<br />42% partial response (PR) rate. The projected median time to progression (TTP) for<br />responding patients was 13.0 months.<br />In a subgroup analysis, the ORR was higher in patients with international working<br />formulation (IWF) B, C and D histological subtypes compared to the IWF A subtype (58%<br />vs 12%), higher in patients whose largest lesion was &lt;5 cm in diameter than in those with<br />diameters &gt;7 cm (53% vs 38%), and higher in patients with chemosensitive relapse<br />compared to those with chemoresistant relapse (defined as duration of response &lt;3 months;<br />50% vs 22%). The ORR in patients with a previous autologous bone marrow transplant&nbsp;</p><p>(ABMT) was 78% vs 43% in those without. Neither age, sex, lymphoma grade, initial<br />diagnosis, presence or absence of a high tumour burden, normal or elevated LDH nor the<br />presence of extranodal disease had a statistically significant effect on response to<br />MabThera.<br />Combination with CVP<br />In a randomised open study a total of 321 treatment-naive patients with low-grade or<br />follicular B-cell NHL received CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2<br />body</p><p>surface area, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2</p><p>body surface area up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1</p><p>and prednisolone 40 mg/m2</p><p>body surface area/day on days 1&ndash;5) every 3 weeks for 8</p><p>treatment cycles or MabThera 375 mg/m<br />2<br />body surface area in combination with CVP<br />(R-CVP). MabThera was administered on day 1 of each treatment cycle. R-CVP performed<br />significantly better than CVP in terms of the primary endpoint (time to &lsquo;treatment failure&rsquo;,<br />defined as progression, relapse after response, initiation of new lymphoma therapy, no<br />response after 4 cycles, death): 25.9 months versus 6.7 months, p&lt;0.0001).<br />Induction therapy and subsequent maintenance therapy in previously untreated patients<br />In a prospective open international phase III multicentre study 1,193 patients with<br />previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma received induction therapy with<br />R-CHOP (N=881), R-CVP (N=268) or R-FCM (N=44) according to the investigating<br />physician&rsquo;s choice. In total 1,078 patients responded to the induction therapy (ORR 99%);<br />of these 1,018 were randomised and allocated to MabThera maintenance therapy (N=505)<br />or observation (N=513).<br />The two treatment groups were well balanced in pretreatment demographics and disease<br />status. MabThera maintenance therapy consisted of a single infusion of MabThera<br />375 mg/m2</p><p>body surface area every 2 months until disease progression or for a maximum</p><p>of 2 years.<br />After a median 25 months follow-up from randomisation MabThera maintenance therapy<br />in patients with previously untreated follicular NHL achieved clinically relevant and<br />statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint &ndash; investigator evaluation of<br />progression-free survival (PFS) &ndash; vs patients without maintenance therapy. The<br />improvement in PFS was confirmed by an independent review committee (IRC).<br />The significant benefit of MabThera maintenance therapy was also observed in the<br />secondary endpoints of event-free survival (EFS) and overall response rate (ORR)<br />(Table 1).<br />Table 1.

The two<br />treatment groups were well balanced in pretreatment demographics and disease status. In<br />total, 334 patients who had achieved complete or partial remission after induction therapy</p><p>were randomised in a second phase to MabThera maintenance therapy (N=167) or follow-<br />up (N=167). MabThera maintenance therapy consisted of a single infusion of MabThera</p><p>375 mg/m2</p><p>body surface area every 3 months until disease progression or for a maximum</p><p>of 2 years.<br />Table 2.

MabThera maintenance therapy caused a clinically<br />relevant and statistically significant improvement of the primary endpoint, progression-free<br />survival (PFS; time from maintenance phase randomisation to relapse, disease progression<br />or patient death), compared to follow-up alone (p&lt;0.0001, log-rank test). Median PFS in<br />the MabThera group was 42.2 months vs 14.3 months in the follow-up group. Cox<br />regression analysis showed that MabThera maintenance therapy reduced the risk of disease<br />progression or patient death by 61% compared to follow-up (95% Cl: 45%&ndash;72%). Kaplan-&nbsp;</p><p>Meier-estimated PFS rates after 12 months were 78% with MabThera maintenance therapy<br />compared to 57% in the follow-up group. Analysis of overall survival confirmed the<br />significant benefit of MabThera maintenance therapy over follow-up (p=0.0039, log-rank<br />test). MabThera maintenance therapy reduced the risk of death by 56% (95% Cl: 22%&ndash;<br />75%).<br />Median time to new lymphoma therapy was significantly longer with MabThera<br />maintenance therapy than with follow-up alone (38.8 months vs 20.1 months, p&lt;0.0001,<br />log-rank test). The risk of having to institute new treatment was halved (95% Cl: 30%&ndash;<br />64%). In patients with CR or CRu as their best response to induction therapy, MabThera<br />maintenance therapy significantly prolonged median disease-free survival (DFS) compared<br />to follow-up (53.7 months vs 16.5 months, p=0.0003, log-rank test; table 3). The risk of<br />relapse in CR patients was reduced by 67% (95% Cl: 39%&ndash;82%).<br />Table 3.

MabThera was<br />administered on day 1 of the treatment cycle. Efficacy was analysed in all randomised<br />patients (CHOP: N=197; R-CHOP: N=202) over a (median) follow-up of approximately<br />31 months. The two treatment groups were well balanced in pretreatment demographics<br />and disease status. The final analysis confirmed that R-CHOP significantly prolonged<br />(p=0.0001) the duration of the primary efficacy endpoint, event-free survival (events:</p><p>death, relapse, lymphoma progression or institution of new lymphoma treatment). Kaplan-<br />Meier estimates of median event-free survival were 35 months in the R-CHOP treatment</p><p>group compared to 13 months in the CHOP treatment group. This was equivalent to a risk<br />reduction of 41%. At 24 months, estimates for overall survival were 68.2% in the R-CHOP<br />group compared to 57.4% in the CHOP group. Subsequent analysis at 60 months<br />confirmed the benefit of R-CHOP over CHOP: the overall survival rate after R-CHOP was<br />62.4% compared with 50.8% in the CHOP group (p=0.0071), representing a survival risk<br />reduction of 32%.&nbsp;</p><p>Analysis of all secondary endpoints (response rates, PFS, DFS, duration of response)<br />confirmed the benefit of R-CHOP treatment over CHOP. The CR rate after treatment<br />cycle 8 was 76.2% in the R-CHOP group compared to 62.4% in the CHOP group<br />(p=0.0028). The risk of disease progression was reduced by 46% and the risk of relapse by<br />51%.<br />In all patient subgroups (sex, age, age-adjusted international prognostic index [IPI], Ann<br />Arbor stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG], &beta;2-microglobulin, LDH,<br />albumin, B-symptoms, high tumour burden, extranodal sites, bone marrow involvement),<br />the risk ratios for event-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP vs CHOP) were less</p><p>than 0.83 and 0.95. R-CHOP treatment correlated with improved outcome for both high-<br />and low-risk patients according to age-adjusted IPI.</p><p>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)<br />In two open-label randomised trials a total of 817 previously untreated patients and 552<br />patients with relapsed/refractory CLL were randomised to receive either FC chemotherapy<br />(fludarabine 25 mg/m2</p><p>, cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2</p><p>, days 1&ndash;3) every 4 weeks for 6<br />cycles or MabThera in combination with FC (R-FC). MabThera was administered in the<br />first cycle at a dosage of 375 mg/m2</p><p>one day before chemotherapy and at a dosage of</p><p>500mg/m2</p><p>on day 1 of each subsequent treatment cycle.</p><p>In the first-line study, median progression-free survival (primary endpoint) was 42.8<br />months in the R-FC group and 32.5 months in the FC group (p&lt;0.0001). The analysis of<br />overall survival showed a survival advantage in the R-FC arm (p=0.0427).<br />The overall response rate was 86.1% vs 72.7%, with complete response (CR) in 36.0% vs<br />17.2% (p&lt;0.0001).<br />In the relapsed/refractory disease study, median progression-free survival (primary<br />endpoint) was 30.6 months in the R-FC group and 20.6 months in the FC group<br />(p=0.0002). Median overall survival has not yet been reached in the R-FC arm and is 51.9<br />months in the FC arm.<br />The overall response rate was 69.9% vs 58.0%, with complete response (CR) in 24.3% vs<br />13.0% (p&lt;0.0007).<br />Rheumatoid arthritis<br />The efficacy and safety of MabThera in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis were<br />demonstrated in three randomised, controlled, double-blind, multicentre studies.<br />Study 1 (WA17042) was a phase III double-blind comparative study with 517 patients who<br />had failed to respond adequately to, or had not tolerated, one or more treatments with TNF<br />inhibitors. In order to be included in the study, patients had to suffer from severe active<br />rheumatoid arthritis that had been diagnosed in accordance with the criteria of the<br />American College of Rheumatology (ACR). The primary endpoint was the percentage of<br />patients who had achieved an ACR 20 response after 24 weeks. On two occasions<br />separated by an interval of 15 days the patients received an i.v. infusion of 1,000 mg<br />MabThera, in each case after infusion of 100 mg methylprednisolone. All patients also&nbsp;</p><p>received oral methotrexate (10&ndash;25 mg/week) plus oral prednisone 60 mg from day 2 to day<br />7 and 30 mg from day 8 to day 14 after the first infusion.<br />Patients were followed beyond week 24 for long-term endpoints, including radiographic<br />assessment at 56 weeks. During this time patients may have received further courses of<br />rituximab under an open-label extension study protocol.<br />Study 2 (WA17043) was a randomised, controlled, double-blind, multifactorial (3 &times; 3),<br />double-dummy phase II study comparing two dosage levels of rituximab (2 &times; 1,000 mg<br />and 2 &times; 500 mg). Rituximab was administered with or without infused glucocorticoid<br />therapy (one of two therapeutic schemes) in combination with weekly methotrexate<br />administration to patients who suffered from active rheumatoid arthritis and had failed to<br />respond to treatment with at least 1&ndash;5 DMARDs other than methotrexate.<br />Study 3 (WA16291) was a controlled, double-blind, double-dummy study assessing<br />rituximab as a single agent and in combination with cyclophosphamide or methotrexate in<br />patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed to respond to treatment with one or<br />more DMARDs.<br />Patients given weekly methotrexate (10&ndash;25 mg per week) served as a comparator group in<br />all three studies.<br />Effect on disease activity<br />In all three studies treatment with 2 &times; 1,000 mg rituximab resulted in a significant increase<br />in the proportion of patients who experienced an improvement of at least 20% in their<br />ACR value compared to treatment with methotrexate alone (Table 4). The therapeutic<br />effect was similar in all patients and was independent of rheumatoid factor status, age, sex,<br />body surface area, race, number of previous treatments and disease status.<br />A clinically and statistically significant improvement was also found in all the individual<br />components of the ACR response (tender and swollen joints, global assessment by patient<br />and physician, HAQ disability index score, pain assessment and C-reactive protein<br />[mg/dl]).<br />Table 4.

The profile of adverse events in these<br />patients provided no evidence of incident autoimmune disease.<br />In rheumatoid factor (RF) positive patients a marked decrease (range: 45%&ndash;64%) in RF<br />concentrations was observed in all three studies after MabThera treatment.<br />The total plasma immunoglobulin concentration, total lymphocyte count and leukocyte<br />count generally remained within normal limits after treatment with MabThera apart from a</p><p>transient fall in leukocyte count in the first 4 weeks after treatment. Titres of antigen-<br />specific IgG antibodies against mumps, rubella, varicella, tetanus toxoid, influenza and</p><p>Streptococcus pneumoniae remained stable for 24 weeks in patients with rheumatoid<br />arthritis after treatment with MabThera.<br />The effect of rituximab on various biomarkers was studied in patients included in study 3<br />(WA16291). This substudy examined the effect of a single treatment cycle of rituximab on&nbsp;</p><p>biochemical marker concentrations. These included inflammatory markers (interleukin-6,<br />C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A protein and S100 protein isotypes A8 and A9),<br />autoantibodies (RF and anticyclic citrullinated peptide), immunoglobulin production and<br />bone turnover (osteocalcin and type 1 collagen N-terminal propeptide [P1NP]). Treatment<br />with rituximab &ndash; as both monotherapy and combination therapy with methotrexate or<br />cyclophosphamide &ndash; significantly decreased inflammatory marker concentrations in the<br />first 24 weeks of follow-up compared to methotrexate alone. The concentration of bone<br />turnover markers osteocalcin and P1NP increased significantly in the groups taking<br />rituximab compared to those taking methotrexate alone.<br />ANCA-associated vasculitis<br />A total of 197 patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) were</p><p>enrolled and treated in an active-controlled, randomised, double-blind, multicentre non-<br />inferiority study. The patients were 15 years of age or older and had been diagnosed with</p><p>either severe active granulomatosis with polyangiitis, also known as Wegener&rsquo;s<br />granulomatosis (75% of patients) or microscopic polyangiitis (24% of patients) according<br />to the criteria of the Chapel Hill consensus conference (in 1% of patients the type of<br />ANCA-associated vasculitis was unknown).<br />Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with either oral<br />cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg body weight/day) for 3&ndash;6 months followed by azathioprine or<br />MabThera (375 mg/m2</p><p>) once weekly for 4 weeks. In both treatment arms patients received<br />intravenous pulse therapy with methylprednisolone 1,000 mg daily (or another<br />glucocorticoid at an equivalent dose) for 1 to 3 days followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg<br />body weight/day, not exceeding 80 mg/day). The prednisone had to have been tapered to<br />zero within 6 months of starting the study treatment.<br />The primary endpoint was the achievement of complete remission after 6 months, defined<br />by a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener&rsquo;s granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) of<br />0 and the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy. The predefined non-inferiority margin<br />for the difference between treatments was 20%. The study showed at least equivalent<br />efficacy (non-inferiority) by MabThera compared to cyclophosphamide with respect to<br />complete remission after 6 months (Table 9). In addition, on the basis of historical control<br />data, the complete remission rate in the MabThera treatment arm was significantly higher<br />than the estimated complete remission rate in patients with severe ANCA-associated<br />vasculitis who were untreated or treated with glucocorticoids only.<br />Efficacy was observed in both patients with newly diagnosed ANCA-associated vasculitis<br />and patients with recurrent disease.&nbsp;</p><p>Table 9.

Maintenance of efficacy in the RAVE study was<br />assessed after 12 and 18 months; the most important secondary endpoints of the study were<br />complete remission after 12 and 18 months. In the rituximab group 44% of patients were in<br />complete remission after 6 and 12 months and 38% after 6, 12 and 18 months. Of the<br />patients treated with cyclophosphamide (followed by azathioprine), 38% were in complete<br />remission after 6 and 12 months and 31% after 6, 12 and 18 months.</p>
