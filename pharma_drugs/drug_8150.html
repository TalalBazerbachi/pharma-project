                <p>The possibility of malignant gastric tumour should be excluded when using DEXILANT because<br />dexlansoprazole can mask the symptoms and delay the diagnosis.<br />Co-administration of dexlansoprazole is not recommended with HIV protease inhibitors for which<br />absorption is dependent on acidic intragastric pH, such as atazanavir or nelfinavir, due to significant<br />reduction in their bioavailability (see section 4.5).<br />Dexlansoprazole should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction.<br />Dexlansoprazole is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2<br />and 5.2).<br />Decreased gastric acidity due to any means, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as<br />dexlansoprazole, increases gastric counts of bacteria normally present in the gastrointestinal tract.<br />Treatment with PPIs may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as<br />Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.<br />Because of limited safety data for patients on treatment for longer than 1 year, regular review of the<br />treatment and a thorough risk/benefit assessment should regularly be performed in these patients.<br />Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like dexlansoprazole for at<br />least three months, in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as<br />fatigue, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin<br />insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after<br />magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged<br />treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or medicinal products that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g.<br />diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI<br />treatment and periodically during treatment.<br />Influence on Vitamin B-12 Absorption<br />Dexlansoprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B-12<br />(cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced<br />body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B-12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective<br />clinical symptoms are observed.<br />Very rarely cases of colitis have been reported in patients taking lansoprazole. Similar effects could<br />be expected with dexlansoprazole. Therefore, in the case of severe and/or persistent diarrhoea,<br />discontinuation of therapy should be considered.<br />Proton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (&gt;1 year), may<br />modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in the<br />presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors<br />may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10&ndash;40%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk<br />factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care according to current clinical guidelines<br />and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.<br />When given together with PPIs, methotrexate levels have been reported to increase in some patients.<br />In high dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of dexlansoprazole may need to be<br />considered.<br />As DEXILANT contains sucrose, patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance,<br />glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal<br />product.<br />Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE)<br />Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially<br />in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical<br />help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping DEXILANT. SCLE after<br />previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton<br />pump inhibitors.<br />Interference with laboratory tests<br />Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours.<br />To avoid this interference, DEXILANT treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA<br />measurements (see section 5.1). If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after<br />initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump<br />inhibitor treatment.</p>

                <p>Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.<br />Effects of other medicinal products on dexlansoprazole<br />CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 have been shown to be involved in the metabolism of dexlansoprazole.<br />Medicinal products which inhibit CYP2C19<br />Inhibitors of CYP2C19 (such as fluvoxamine) would likely increase the systemic exposure of<br />dexlansoprazole.<br />Medicinal products which induce CYP2C19 and CYP3A4<br />Enzyme inducers affecting CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 such as rifampicin, and St John&rsquo;s wort<br />(Hypericum perforatum) may reduce the plasma concentrations of dexlansoprazole.<br />Others<br />Sucralfate/Antacids<br />Sucralfate/Antacids may decrease the bioavailability of dexlansoprazole. Therefore dexlansoprazole<br />should be taken at least 1 hour after taking these drugs.<br />Effects of dexlansoprazole on other medicinal products<br />Medicinal products with pH dependent absorption<br />Dexlansoprazole may interfere with the absorption of medicinal products where gastric pH is critical<br />to bioavailability.<br />HIV protease inhibitors<br />Co-administration of dexlansoprazole is not recommended with HIV protease inhibitors for which<br />absorption is dependent on acidic intragastric pH, such as atazanavir or nelfinavir; due to significant<br />reduction in their bioavailability (see section 4.4).<br />Ketoconazole, itraconazole and erlotinib<br />The absorption of ketoconazole, itraconazole and erlotinib from the gastrointestinal tract is enhanced<br />by the presence of gastric acid. Administration of dexlansoprazole may result in sub-therapeutic<br />concentrations of ketoconazole, itraconazole and erlotinib, and the combination should be avoided.<br />Digoxin<br />Co-administration of dexlansoprazole and digoxin may lead to increased digoxin plasma levels. The<br />plasma levels of digoxin should therefore be monitored and the dose of digoxin adjusted if necessary<br />when initiating and ending dexlansoprazole treatment.<br />Medicinal products metabolised by P450 enzymes<br />In vitro studies have shown that DEXILANT is not likely to inhibit CYP isoforms 1A1, 1A2, 2A6,<br />2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A4. As such, no clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products<br />metabolised by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that<br />DEXILANT did not have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered phenytoin (CYP2C9<br />substrate) or theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate). The subjects&rsquo; CYP1A2 genotypes in the drug-drug<br />interaction study with theophylline were not determined. Although in vitro studies demonstrated that<br />DEXILANT has the potential to inhibit CYP2C19, an in vivo drug-drug interaction study in mainly<br />CYP2C19 extensive and intermediate metabolisers has shown that DEXILANT does not affect the<br />pharmacokinetics of diazepam (CYP2C19 substrate).<br />Tacrolimus<br />Co-administration of dexlansoprazole may increase the plasma concentrations of tacrolimus (a<br />CYP3A and P-glycoprotein [P-gp] substrate), especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or<br />poor metabolisers of CYP2C19. Monitoring of tacrolimus plasma concentrations is advised when<br />concomitant treatment with dexlansoprazole is initiated or ended.<br />Warfarin<br />In a study, co-administration of DEXILANT and warfarin did not result in any significant differences<br />in the pharmacokinetics of warfarin or International Normalised Ratio (INR) compared to<br />administration of warfarin with placebo. However, there have been reports of increased INR and<br />prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs and warfarin concomitantly. Patients treated with PPIs<br />and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time,<br />especially when initiating or ending concomitant treatment.<br />Clopidogrel<br />A study has shown that concomitant administration of dexlansoprazole (60 mg once daily) and<br />clopidogrel 75 mg to healthy volunteers resulted in a reduction in the exposure to the active<br />metabolite of clopidogrel (approximately 9% decrease in AUC and 27% decrease in Cmax).<br />Co-administration of dexlansoprazole had no clinically meaningful effect on pharmacodynamics of<br />clopidogrel. No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved<br />dose of DEXILANT.<br />Methotrexate<br />Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that<br />concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate<br />prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite<br />hydroxymethotrexate possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. Therefore, in settings where highdose<br />methotrexate is used a temporary withdrawal of dexlansoprazole may need to be considered.<br />However, no formal drug interaction studies of high-dose methotrexate with PPIs have been<br />conducted.<br />Medicinal products transported by P-glycoprotein<br />Lansoprazole has been observed to inhibit the transport protein, P-gp in vitro. Similar effects could be<br />expected with dexlansoprazole. The clinical relevance of this is unknown.<br />Others<br />No clinically significant interactions of dexlansoprazole with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<br />have been demonstrated, although no formal interactions studies have been performed.</p>

                <p>Summary of the safety profile<br />Adults<br />DEXILANT at doses of 30, 60, or 90 mg has been evaluated for safety in clinical studies in patients<br />treated for up to 1 year. In these clinical studies, adverse reactions associated with treatment with<br />DEXILANT were mostly mild or moderate, with an overall incidence similar to placebo and<br />lansoprazole. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were diarrhoea, abdominal pain,<br />headache, nausea, abdominal discomfort, flatulence and constipation. The incidence of these adverse<br />reactions was not affected by gender, age, or race.<br />Tabulated list of adverse reactions<br />Adverse reactions reported for DEXILANT (30 mg, 60 mg or 90 mg) in clinical studies and postmarketing<br />experience are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute<br />frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (&ge; 1/10); common (&ge; 1/100 to &lt; 1/10);<br />uncommon (&ge; 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (&ge; 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); not known<br />(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are<br />presented in order of decreasing seriousness.</p><p>Description of selected adverse reactions<br />Diarrhoea and abdominal pain<br />In the Phase 3 clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse reaction was diarrhoea (excluding<br />infective diarrhoea), the majority of which were non serious. Overall, few subjects (2.4%)<br />prematurely discontinued due to an adverse reaction while receiving dexlansoprazole therapy. The<br />most common (&ge; 0.5%) adverse reactions leading to premature discontinuation were diarrhoea,<br />gastrointestinal and abdominal pains. Initial onset of diarrhoea and abdominal pain was independent<br />of the duration of exposure, and the majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity. There<br />were no apparent dose-related trends observed across dexlansoprazole doses for the incidence of these<br />events.<br />Hypersensitivity<br />There have been post-marketing cases reporting serious hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity<br />reactions were more frequently reported in females (74%). The majority of the serious cases were<br />managed with steroids and/or antihistamines and withdrawal of the medicinal product. Severe<br />reactions of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) were reported in<br />few patients.<br />Haemolytic anaemia<br />There have been few serious post-marketing reports of haemolytic anaemia after approximately four<br />to seven months on dexlansoprazole 60 mg therapy.<br />Paediatric population<br />The safety profile for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years is similar to adults. In clinical studies of 166<br />adolescent patients, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than one patient was abdominal<br />pain. Additional adverse reactions, which occurred in one patient each, included diarrhoea, urticaria,<br />dry mouth and headache.<br />Reporting of suspected adverse reactions<br />Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It<br />allows continued monitoring of the&nbsp;benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare<br />professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national pharmacovigilance<br />and drug safety centre (NPC)</p>

                <p>The effects of overdose of dexlansoprazole in humans are not known (although the acute toxicity is<br />likely to be low) and, consequently, instruction for treatment cannot be given.<br />There have been no reports of significant overdose of DEXILANT. Multiple doses of DEXILANT<br />120 mg and a single dose of DEXILANT 300 mg did not result in death or other severe adverse<br />events. Serious adverse reactions of hypertension have been reported in association with twice daily<br />doses of DEXILANT 60 mg. Non-serious adverse reactions observed with twice daily doses of<br />DEXILANT 60 mg include hot flushes, contusion, oropharyngeal pain, and weight loss.<br />In the case of suspected overdose the patient should be monitored. Dexlansoprazole is not<br />significantly eliminated by haemodialysis. If necessary, gastric emptying, charcoal and symptomatic<br />therapy is recommended.</p>

                <p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: Proton pump inhibitors, ATC code: A02BC06<br />Mechanism of action<br />Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of lansoprazole. It is a gastric PPI. It inhibits the final stage of<br />gastric acid formation by inhibiting the activity of H+/K+ ATPase of the parietal cells in the stomach.<br />The inhibition is dose-dependent and reversible, and the effect applies to both basal and stimulated<br />secretion of gastric acid. Dexlansoprazole is concentrated in the parietal cells and becomes active in<br />their acidic environment, whereupon it reacts with the sulphydryl group of H+/K+ATPase causing<br />inhibition of the enzyme activity.<br />Pharmacodynamic effects<br />Antisecretory activity<br />The antisecretory activity of DEXILANT has been studied in healthy subjects taking dexlansoprazole<br />60 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg once daily for five days. The average intragastric pH was 4.55 for<br />DEXILANT and 4.13 for lansoprazole. The average percentage of time throughout the day in which<br />the intragastric pH is maintained above 4 was 71% (17 hours) with DEXILANT and 60% (14 hours)<br />with lansoprazole.<br />Serum gastrin effect<br />The effect of DEXILANT on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in patients in clinical trials<br />up to 12 months. The mean fasting gastrin concentrations increased from baseline during treatment<br />with DEXILANT 30 mg and 60 mg doses. In patients treated for more than 6 months, mean serum<br />gastrin levels increased during approximately the first 3 months of treatment and were stable for the<br />remainder of treatment. Mean serum gastrin levels returned to pre-treatment levels within one month<br />of discontinuation of treatment.<br />Please contact the relevant competent authority.<br />During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products, serum gastrin increases in response to the<br />decreased acid secretion. Also CgA increases due to decreased gastric acidity. The increased CgA<br />level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours.<br />Available published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be discontinued between 5<br />days and 2 weeks prior to CgA measurements. This is to allow CgA levels that might be spuriously<br />elevated following PPI treatment to return to reference range.<br />Enterochromaffin-Like Cell (ECL) Effects<br />There were no reports of ECL cell hyperplasia in gastric biopsy specimens obtained from patients<br />treated with DEXILANT 30 mg, 60 mg or 90 mg for up to 12 months.<br />Effect on Cardiac Repolarisation<br />A study was conducted to assess the potential of DEXILANT to prolong the QT/QTc interval in<br />healthy adult subjects. DEXILANT doses of 90 mg or 300 mg did not delay cardiac repolarisation<br />compared to placebo. The positive control (moxifloxacin) produced statistically significantly greater<br />mean maximum and time-averaged QT/QTc intervals compared to placebo.<br />Clinical efficacy and safety<br />Treatment of erosive reflux oesophagitis<br />Two multi-center, double-blind, active-controlled, randomised, 8-week studies were conducted in<br />patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive reflux oesophagitis. Severity of the disease was<br />classified based on the Los Angeles Classification Grading System (Grades A-D). Patients were<br />randomised to one of the following three treatment groups: DEXILANT 60 mg daily, DEXILANT<br />90 mg daily or lansoprazole 30 mg daily. A total of 4092 patients were enrolled and ranged in age<br />from 18 to 90 years (median age 48 years) with 54% male. Based on the Los Angeles Classification,<br />71% of patients had Grades A and B erosive reflux oesophagitis (mild) and 29% of patients had<br />Grades C and D erosive reflux oesophagitis (moderate to severe) before treatment.<br />By the life-table method of analysis DEXILANT 60 mg healed 92.3% to 93.1% of patients versus<br />86.1% to 91.5% for lansoprazole 30 mg after 8 weeks of treatment (primary). Non-inferiority was<br />demonstrated in both studies. Statistical superiority was not established using log-rank tests.<br />After 4 weeks of treatment (secondary), the healing rates by the life-table method were 77.0% to<br />80.1% versus 76.5% to 77.0% for lansoprazole 30 mg.<br />The life-table healing rates at Week 8 for patients with moderate to severe erosive reflux oesophagitis<br />(secondary) were 88.9% and 74.5% for DEXILANT 60 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg, respectively, in<br />the first study. The difference was statistically significant (p=0.011). In the second study, the Week 8<br />life-table healing rates were 87.6% and 87.7% for DEXILANT 60 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg,<br />respectively, and were not statistically significantly different.<br />DEXILANT 90 mg was studied and did not provide additional clinical benefit over DEXILANT<br />60 mg.<br />Maintenance of healed erosive reflux oesophagitis<br />A multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study was conducted in patients who<br />successfully completed an erosive reflux oesophagitis study and showed endoscopically confirmed<br />healed erosive reflux oesophagitis. Maintenance of healing and symptom relief over a six-month<br />period were evaluated with DEXILANT 30 mg or 60 mg once daily compared to placebo. A total of<br />445 patients were enrolled and ranged in age from 18 to 85 years (median age 49 years), with 52%<br />female.<br />By the life-table method, DEXILANT 30 mg and 60 mg demonstrated statistically significantly higher<br />rates of maintenance of healed erosive reflux oesophagitis (74.9% and 82.5%, respectively) than<br />placebo (27.2%) at Month 6 (p&lt;0.00001).<br />For patients with more severe grades of erosive reflux oesophagitis (Grades C or D) before healing,<br />DEXILANT 30 mg and 60 mg also achieved statistically significantly higher 6-month maintenance<br />rates than placebo by the life-table method.<br />DEXILANT 30 mg and 60 mg achieved statistically significantly (p&lt;0.00001) greater percentages of<br />heartburn relief during the study treatment period. The median percentages of 24-hour heartburn-free<br />days were 96.1%, 90.9% and 28.6% for DEXILANT 30 mg, 60 mg and placebo, respectively. The<br />median percentages of nights without heartburn were 98.9%, 96.2% and 71.7% for DEXILANT<br />30 mg, 60 mg and placebo, respectively.<br />In a second study (N=451) of DEXILANT 60 mg and 90 mg versus placebo, DEXILANT 60 mg<br />showed similar results to the first study in the maintenance of healed erosive reflux oesophagitis and<br />heartburn relief. DEXILANT 90 mg did not provide additional clinical benefit over DEXILANT<br />60 mg.<br />Symptomatic non-erosive GORD<br />A multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 4-week study was conducted in patients<br />with a diagnosis of symptomatic GORD made primarily by presentation of symptoms. These patients<br />who identified heartburn as their primary symptom, had a history of heartburn for 6 months or longer,<br />had heartburn on at least 4 of 7 days immediately prior to randomisation and had no esophageal<br />erosions as confirmed by endoscopy. However, patients with symptoms which were not acid-related<br />may not have been excluded using these inclusion criteria. Patients were randomised to one of the<br />following treatment groups: DEXILANT 30 mg daily, 60 mg daily, or placebo. A total of 947 patients<br />were enrolled and ranged in age from 18 to 86 years (median age 48 years) with 71% female.<br />DEXILANT 30 mg provided statistically significantly greater percent of days with heartburn-free<br />24-hour periods and percent of nights without heartburn (respectively 54.9% and 80.8%) over placebo<br />(respectively 18.5% and 51.7%) as assessed by daily diary over 4 weeks. A higher percentage of<br />patients on DEXILANT 30 mg had heartburn-free 24-hour periods compared to placebo through<br />4 weeks of treatment. DEXILANT 60 mg was studied and provided no additional clinical benefit over<br />DEXILANT 30 mg.<br />A second multi-center, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 4-week study was conducted in<br />patients with a history of nocturnal heartburn and GORD associated sleep disturbances on at least 3 of<br />7 nights immediately prior to randomisation. Patients were randomised to receive DEXILANT 30 mg<br />or placebo daily. A total of 305 patients were enrolled and ranged in age from 18 to 66 years (median<br />age 45 years) with 63.9% female. DEXILANT 30 mg provided statistically significantly greater<br />percent of nights without heartburn (73.1%) over placebo (35.7%) as assessed by daily diary over<br />4 weeks.<br />A third multi-center, single blind study enrolled 178 patients with a history of symptomatic GORD.<br />Patients whose symptoms were well-controlled during a run-in period while taking a PPI other than<br />DEXILANT twice a day subsequently received blinded DEXILANT 30 mg (morning) and placebo<br />(evening) for 6 weeks. Well-controlled was defined as having a weekly average of &le;1 episode of<br />heartburn during the last 4 weeks of both the 6 week run-in and treatment periods. A total of<br />142 patients were included in the analysis. Ages ranged from 22 to 90 years (median age 53 years)<br />with 56% female. After switching from twice daily PPI therapy to once daily DEXILANT 30 mg,<br />88% of patients&rsquo; heartburn remained well-controlled.<br />Paediatric population<br />Treatment of erosive reflux oesophagitis, maintenance of healed erosive reflux oesophagitis and relief<br />of heartburn<br />In a multi-center, 24-week study, 62 adolescents with a documented history of GORD for at least 3<br />months and endoscopically-proven erosive reflux oesophagitis were treated with DEXILANT 60 mg<br />once daily, for 8 weeks to evaluate safety and effectiveness. Patients ranged in age from 12 to 17<br />years (median age 15 years) with 61% being male. Based on the Los Angeles Classification Grading<br />Scale, 96.8% of the erosive reflux oesophagitis patients had mild erosive reflux oesophagitis (Grades<br />A and B), and 3.2% of patients had moderate to severe erosive reflux oesophagitis (Grades C and D)<br />before treatment. The erosive reflux oesophagitis healing rate in adolescents was 87.9%, which is<br />similar to adults, for up to 8 weeks of treatment.<br />After the initial 8 weeks of treatment, patients with endoscopically confirmed healed erosive reflux<br />oesophagitis were randomised to receive treatment with DEXILANT 30 mg or placebo, once daily for<br />an additional 16 weeks. Eighty-two percent of patients treated with 30 mg of DEXILANT remained<br />healed over the four-month treatment period as confirmed by endoscopy versus 58% for placebo.<br />During the 16-week maintenance period, the median percentage of 24-hour heartburn-free periods was<br />86.6% for those receiving DEXILANT 30 mg compared to 68.1% for those receiving placebo.<br />The results for maintenance of healing and relief of heartburn were similar to adults.<br />Symptomatic non-erosive GORD<br />In an uncontrolled, open-label, multi-center study, 104 adolescents with symptomatic non-erosive<br />GORD were treated with DEXILANT 30 mg once daily, for 4 weeks to evaluate safety and<br />effectiveness. Patients had a documented history of GORD symptoms for at least 3 months prior to<br />screening, reported heartburn on at least three out of seven days during screening, and had no<br />oesophageal erosions as confirmed by endoscopy. Patients ranged in age from 12 to 17 years (median<br />age 15 years) with 70% being female. During the 4-week treatment period, the median percentage of<br />24-hour heartburn-free periods was 47.3% which was similar to adults.</p>

                <p>The formulation of DEXILANT utilising dual delayed release technology results in a dexlansoprazole<br />plasma concentration-time profile with two distinct peaks; the first peak occurs 1 to 2 hours after<br />administration, followed by a second peak within 4 to 5 hours.<br />Absorption<br />After oral administration of DEXILANT 30 mg or 60 mg to healthy subjects, mean Cmax and AUC<br />values of dexlansoprazole increased approximately dose proportionally. Peak plasma levels occur<br />within 4 to 6 hours.<br />Distribution<br />Plasma protein binding of dexlansoprazole ranged from 96.1% to 98.8% in healthy subjects and was<br />independent of concentration from 0.01 to 20 mcg per mL. The apparent volume of distribution after<br />multiple doses in symptomatic GORD patients was 40.3 L.<br />Biotransformation<br />Dexlansoprazole is extensively metabolised in the liver by oxidation, reduction, and subsequent<br />formation of sulfate, glucuronide and glutathione conjugates to inactive metabolites. Oxidative<br />metabolites are formed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system including hydroxylation<br />mainly by CYP2C19, and oxidation to the sulfone by CYP3A4. CYP2C19 is a polymorphic liver<br />enzyme which exhibits three phenotypes in the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates; extensive<br />metabolisers (*1/*1), intermediate metabolisers (*1/mutant) and poor metabolisers (mutant/mutant).<br />Systemic exposure of dexlansoprazole is generally higher in intermediate and poor metabolisers.<br />Dexlansoprazole is the major circulating component in plasma, regardless of CYP2C19 metaboliser<br />status. In CYP2C19 intermediate and extensive metabolisers, the major plasma metabolites are<br />5-hydroxy dexlansoprazole and its glucuronide conjugate, while in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers<br />dexlansoprazole sulfone is the major plasma metabolite.<br />Elimination<br />Following the administration of DEXILANT, no unchanged dexlansoprazole is excreted in urine.<br />Following the administration of [14C] dexlansoprazole to healthy male subjects, approximately 50.7%<br />of the administered radioactivity was excreted in urine and 47.6% in the feces. Apparent clearance in<br />healthy subjects was 11.4 to 11.6 L/h, respectively, after 5-days of 30 or 60 mg once daily<br />administration.<br />Linearity/non-linearity<br />Following a single and multiple daily dexlansoprazole 30 to 120 mg doses to healthy subjects, mean<br />dexlansoprazole Cmax and AUC values increased approximately dose proportionally over the entire<br />dose range. The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole was both dose- and time-independent, with an<br />estimated terminal elimination half-life of approximately 1 to 2 hours. Therefore, little or no active<br />substance accumulation was observed for dexlansoprazole after once daily doses of dexlansoprazole,<br />as evidenced by similar Cmax and AUC values after a single and multiple once-daily doses at steadystate.<br />Effect of food<br />DEXILANT can be taken without regard to food or the timing of food. In food-effect studies in<br />healthy subjects receiving DEXILANT, increases in Cmax ranged from 12% to 55% and increases in<br />AUC ranged from 9% to 37% under various fed conditions compared to fasting. However, no relevant<br />differences with regard to intragastric pH were observed. An additional study showed that<br />administration of 60 mg DEXILANT prior to consumption of breakfast, lunch, dinner or an evening<br />snack did not have an effect on dexlansoprazole exposure, or a clinically relevant effect on 24-hour<br />intragastric pH control.<br />Special patient populations<br />Elderly<br />In a study of male and female healthy subjects who received a single oral dose of DEXILANT 60 mg,<br />the terminal elimination half-life of dexlansoprazole was statistically significantly longer in elderly<br />subjects compared to younger subjects (2.23 and 1.5 hours, respectively). In addition, dexlansoprazole<br />exhibited higher systemic exposure (AUC) in elderly subjects (34.5% higher) than younger subjects.<br />These differences were not clinically relevant. A daily dose of 60 mg should not be exceeded in the<br />elderly unless there are compelling clinical indications.<br />Renal impairment<br />Dexlansoprazole is extensively metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites, and no parent active<br />substance is recovered in the urine following an oral dose of dexlansoprazole. Therefore, the<br />pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole are not expected to be altered in patients with renal impairment,<br />and no studies were conducted in subjects with renal impairment (see section 4.4).<br />Hepatic impairment<br />In a study of patients with moderately impaired hepatic function who received a single oral dose of<br />DEXILANT 60 mg, plasma exposure (AUC) of bound and unbound dexlansoprazole in the hepatic<br />impairment group was approximately 2 times greater compared to subjects with normal hepatic<br />function. This difference in exposure was not due to a difference in protein binding between the two<br />liver function groups. No adjustment for DEXILANT is necessary for patients with mild hepatic<br />impairment. DEXILANT 30 mg should be considered for patients with moderate hepatic impairment.<br />No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment, the use of<br />dexlansoprazole is not recommended for these patients (see section 4.4).<br />Paediatric population<br />The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole were studied in 36 patients with symptomatic GORD aged<br />12 to 17 years in a multi-center study. Patients were randomised to receive DEXILANT 30 mg or 60<br />mg once daily for 7 days. In adolescents, dexlansoprazole mean Cmax was 81% to 105% of the adult<br />mean Cmax value, mean AUC was 78% to 88% of the adult mean AUC value, and mean CL/F was<br />112% to 132% of the adult mean CL/F value. Overall, dexlansoprazole pharmacokinetics in patients<br />aged 12 to 17 years were similar to those observed in healthy adults.<br />Gender<br />In a study of male and female healthy subjects who received a single oral dose of DEXILANT 60 mg,<br />females had higher (42.8%) systemic exposure (AUC) than males. No dosage adjustment is necessary<br />in patients based on gender.</p>

                <p>Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety<br />pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development.<br />Lansoprazole is a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomers. Following administration of lansoprazole<br />in humans and animals, the major component circulating in plasma is dexlansoprazole, the Renantiomer<br />of lansoprazole. Therefore, the carcinogenic potential of dexlansoprazole was assessed<br />using existing lansoprazole studies.<br />In rat carcinogenicity studies, lansoprazole produced dose-related gastric ECL cell hyperplasia and<br />ECL cell carcinoids associated with hypergastrinaemia due to inhibition of acid secretion. Intestinal<br />metaplasia was also observed, as were Leydig cell hyperplasia and benign Leydig cell tumours in the<br />testes. After 18 months of treatment retinal atrophy was observed. This was not observed in monkeys,<br />dogs, or mice.<br />In mouse carcinogenicity studies dose-related gastric ECL cell hyperplasia developed as well as liver<br />tumours and adenoma of rete testis.<br />The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.<br />Lansoprazole was positive in the Ames test and the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal<br />aberration assay. Lansoprazole was not genotoxic in the ex vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA<br />synthesis (UDS) test, the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, or the rat bone marrow cell chromosomal<br />aberration test.<br />Dexlansoprazole was positive in the Ames test and in the in vitro chromosome aberration test using<br />Chinese hamster lung cells. Dexlansoprazole was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.<br />A reproduction study conducted in rabbits at oral dexlansoprazole doses up to approximately 9 times<br />the maximum recommended human dexlansoprazole dose (60 mg per day), based on body surface<br />area (BSA), revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dexlansoprazole. In addition,<br />reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats with oral lansoprazole at doses up to 40 times the<br />recommended human lansoprazole dose, based on BSA, and in pregnant rabbits at oral lansoprazole<br />doses up to 16 times the recommended human lansoprazole dose, based on BSA, revealed no evidence<br />of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to lansoprazole.</p>
