                <p>Aldara cream may be used for three different conditions. Your doctor may prescribe Aldara<br />cream for the treatment of:<br />● Warts (condylomata acuminata) on the surface of the genitals (sexual organs) and around the<br />anus (back passage)<br />● Superficial basal cell carcinoma.<br />This is a common slow-growing form of skin cancer with a very small likelihood of spread to<br />other parts of the body. It usually occurs in middle-aged and elderly people, especially those<br />who are fair-skinned and is caused by too much sun exposure. If left untreated, basal cell<br />carcinoma can disfigure, especially on the face &ndash; therefore early recognition and treatment<br />are important.<br />● Actinic keratosis<br />Actinic keratoses are rough areas of skin found in people who have been exposed to a lot of<br />sunshine over the course of their lifetime. Some are skin coloured, others are greyish, pink,<br />red or brown. They can be flat and scaly, or raised, rough, hard and warty. Aldara should<br />only be used for flat actinic keratoses on the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune<br />system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you.<br />Aldara cream helps your body&acute;s own immune system to produce natural substances which help<br />fight your basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis or the virus that has caused your warts.</p>

                <p>Do not use Aldara cream:<br />&ndash; If you are allergic to imiquimod (the active ingredient) or any of the ingredients of the cream.<br />Take special care with Aldara cream:<br />● If you have previously used Aldara cream or other similar preparations tell your doctor<br />before starting this treatment.<br />● Tell your doctor if you have problems with your immune system.<br />● Do not use Aldara cream until the area to be treated has healed after previous drug or surgical<br />treatment.<br />● Avoid contact with the eyes, lips and nostrils. In the event of accidental contact, remove<br />cream by rinsing with water.<br />● Do not apply the cream internally.<br />● Do not use more cream than your doctor has advised.<br />● Do not cover the treated area with bandages or other dressings after you have applied Aldara<br />cream.<br />● If the treated site becomes too uncomfortable, wash the cream off with mild soap and water.<br />As soon as the problem has stopped you may restart to apply the cream.<br />● Tell your doctor if you have an abnormal blood count.<br />Because of the way Aldara works, there is a possibility that the cream may worsen existing<br />inflammation in the treatment area.<br />● If you are being treated for genital warts follow these additional precautions:<br />Men with warts under the foreskin should pull the foreskin back each day and wash<br />underneath it. If not washed daily the foreskin may be more likely to show signs of tightness,<br />swelling and wearing away of the skin and result in difficulty in pulling it back. If these<br />symptoms occur, stop the treatment immediately and call your doctor.<br />If you have open sores: do not start using Aldara cream until after the sores have healed. If<br />you have internal warts: do not use Aldara cream in the urethra (the hole from which urine is<br />passed), the vagina (birth canal), the cervix (internal female organ), or anywhere inside your<br />anus (rectum).<br />Do not use this&nbsp;medication for more than one course if you have problems with your immune<br />system, either due to illness or because of the medicines you are already taking. If you think<br />this applies to you talk to your doctor.<br />If you are HIV positive you should inform your doctor as Aldara cream has not been shown<br />to be as effective in HIV positive patients. If you decide to have sexual relations while you<br />still have warts, apply Aldara cream after - not before - sexual activity. Aldara cream may<br />weaken condoms and diaphragms, therefore the cream should not be left on during sexual<br />activity. Remember, Aldara cream does not protect against giving HIV or other sexually<br />transmitted diseases to someone else.<br />● If you are being treated for basal cell carcinoma or actinic keratosis follow these additional<br />precautions:<br />Do not use sunlamps or tanning beds, and avoid sunlight as much as possible during<br />treatment with Aldara cream. Wear protective clothing and wide brimmed hats when<br />outdoors.<br />Whilst using Aldara cream and until healed, the treatment area is likely to appear noticeably<br />different from normal skin.</p><p>Using other medicines:<br />Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other<br />medicines, including those obtained without a prescription.<br />There are no medicines known to be incompatible with Aldara cream.<br />Pregnancy and breast-feeding:<br />Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.<br />You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will<br />discuss the risks and benefits of using Aldara cream during pregnancy. Studies in animals do not<br />indicate direct or indirect harmful effects in pregnancy.<br />Do not breast-feed your infant during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether<br />imiquimod is secreted in human milk.<br />Important information about some of the ingredients of Aldara cream:<br />Methyl hydroxybenzoate (E218) and propyl hydroxybenzoate (E216) may cause allergic<br />reactions (possibly delayed). Cetyl and stearyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact<br />dermatitis).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Posology<br />The application frequency and duration of treatment with imiquimod cream is different for each<br />indication.<br />External genital warts in adults:<br />lmiquimod cream should be applied 3 times per week (example: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; or<br />Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday) prior to normal sleeping hours, and should remain on the skin for<br />6 to 10 hours. Imiquimod cream treatment should continue until the clearance of visible genital or<br />perianal warts or for a maximum of 16 weeks per episode of warts.<br />For quantity to be applied see section 4.2 􀂭ethod of administration.</p><p>Superficial basal cell carcinoma in adults:<br />Apply imiquimod cream for 6 weeks, 5 times per week (example: Monday to Friday) prior to normal<br />sleeping hours, and leave on the skin for approximately 8 hours.<br />For quantity to be applied see 4.2 Method of administration.</p><p>Actinic keratosis in adults<br />Treatment should be initiated and monitored by a physician. Imiquimod cream should be applied<br />3 times per week (example: Monday, Wednesday and Friday) for four weeks prior to normal sleeping<br />hours, and left on the skin for approximately 8 hours. Sufficient cream should be applied to cover the<br />treatment area. After a 4-week treatment-free period, clearance of AKs should be assessed. If any<br />lesions persist, treatment should be repeated for another four weeks.<br />The maximum recommended dose is one sachet. The maximum recommended treatment duration is<br />8 weeks.<br />An interruption of dosing should be considered if intense local inflammatory reactions occur (see<br />section 4.4) or if infection is observed at the treatment site. In this latter case, appropriate other<br />measures should be taken. Each treatment period should not be extended beyond 4 weeks due co<br />missed doses or rest periods.<br />lf the treated lesion(s) show an incomplete response at the follow-up examination at 4-8 weeks after<br />the second treatment period, a different therapy should be used (see section 4.4)<br />Information applicable to all indications:<br />If a dose is missed, the patient should apply the cream as soon as he/she remember and then he/she<br />should continue with the regular schedule. However the cream should not be applied more than once<br />a􀂧<br />Paediatric population<br />Use in the paediatric patient population is not recommended. There are no data available on the use of<br />imiquimod in children and adolescents in the approved indications.<br />Aldara should not be used in children with molluscum contagiosum due to lack of efficacy in this<br />indication (see section 5.1).</p><p>Method of administration<br />External genital warts:<br />hniquimod cream should be applied in a thin layer and rubbed on the clean wart area until the cream<br />vanishes. Only apply to affected areas and avoid any application on internal surfaces. Imiquimod<br />cream should be applied prior to nonnal sleeping hours. During the 6 to IO hour treatment period,<br />showering or bathing should be avoided. After this period it is essential that imiquimod cream is<br />removed with mild soap and water. Application of an excess of cream or prolonged contact with the<br />skin may result in a severe application site reaction (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 4.9). A single-use sachet<br />is sufficient to cover a wart area of 20 cm2 (approx. 3 inches2). Sachets should not be re-used once<br />opened. Hands should be washed carefully before and after application of cream.<br />Uncircumcised males treating warts under the foreskin should retract the foreskin and wash the area<br />daily (see section 4.4).<br />Superficial basal cell carcinoma:</p><p>Before applying imiquimod cream, patients should wash the treatment area with mild soap and water and dry thoroughly, Sufficient cream should be applied to cover the treatment area including one&nbsp;centimetre of skin surrounding the tumour. The cream should be rubbed into the treatment area until<br />the cream vanishes. The cream should be applied prior to normal sleeping hours and remain on the<br />skin for approximately 8 hours. During this period, showering and bathing should be avoided. After<br />this period it is essential that imiquimod cream is removed with mild soap and water.<br />Sachets should not be re-used once opened. Hands should be washed carefully before and after<br />application of cream.<br />Response of the treated tumour to imiquimod cream should be assessed 12 weeks after the end of<br />treatment. If the treated tumour shows an incomplete response, a different therapy should be used (see<br />section 4.4).<br />A rest period of several days may be taken (see section 4.4) if the local skin reaction to imiquimod<br />cream causes excessive discomfort to the patient, or if infection is observed at the treatment site. In<br />this latter case, appropriate other measures should be taken.<br />Actinic keratosis:<br />Before applying imiquimod cream, patients should wash the treatment area with mild soap and water<br />and dry thoroughly. Sufficient cream should be applied to cover the treatment area. The cream should<br />be rubbed into the treatment area until the cream vanishes. The cream should be applied prior to<br />normal sleeping hours and remain on the skin for approximately 8 hours. During this period,<br />showering and bathing should be avoided.

                <p>External genital warts. superficial basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis:<br />Avoid contact with the eyes, lips and nostrils.<br />lmiquimod has the potential to exacerbate inflammatory conditions of the skin.<br />lmiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients with autoimmune conditions (refer to<br />section 4.5). Consideration should be given to balancing the benefit of imiquimod treatment for these<br />patients with the risk associated with a possible worsening of their autoimmune condition.<br />lmiquimod cream should be used witycaution in organ transplant patients (refer to section 4.5).<br />Consideration should be given to balancing the benefit of imiquimod treatment for these patients with<br />the risk associated with the possibility of organ rejection or graft-versus-host disease.<br />lmiquimod cream therapy is not recommended until the skin has healed after any previous drug or<br />surgical treatment. Application to broken skin could result in increased systemic absorption of<br />imiquimod leading to a greater risk of adverse events (re!er to section 4.8 and 4.9)<br />The use of an occlusive dressing is not recommended with imiquimod cream therapy.<br />/<br />The excipients methyl hydroxybenzoate (E 218) and propyl hydroxybenzoate (E 216) may cause<br />allergic reactions (possibly&nbsp;delayed). Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions<br />(e.g. contact dermatitis).</p><p>Rarely, intense local inflammatory reactions including skin weeping or erosion can occur after only a<br />few applications of imiquimod cream. Local inflammatory reactions may be accompanied, or even<br />preceded, by flu-like systemic signs and symptoms including malaise, pyrexia, nausea, myalgias and<br />rigors. An interruption of dosing should be considered.<br />Imiquimod should be used with caution in patients with reduced haematologic reserve (refer to<br />section 4.8d).<br />External genital warts:<br />There is limited experience in the use of imiquimod cream in the treatment of men with foreskinassociated<br />warts. The safety database in uncircumcised men treated with imiquimod cream three times<br />weekly and carrying out a daily foreskin hygiene routine is less than 100 patients. In other studies, in<br />which a daily foreskin hygiene routine was not followed, there were two cases of severe phimosis and<br />one case of stricture leading to circumcision. Treatment in this patient population is therefore<br />recommended only in men who are able or willing to follow the daily foreskin hygiene routine. Early<br />signs of stricture may include local skin reactions ( e.g. erosion, ulceration, oedema, induration), or<br />increasing difficulty in retracting the foreskin. If these symptoms occur, the treatment should be<br />stopped immediately. Based on current knowledge, treating urethral, intra-vaginal, cervical, rectal or<br />intra-anal warts is not recommended. Imiquimod cream therapy should not be initiated in tissues<br />where open sores or wounds exist until after the area has healed.<br />Local skin reactions such as erythema, erosion, excoriation, flaking and oedema are common. Other<br />local reactions such as induration, ulceration, scabbing, and vesicles have also been reported. Should<br />an intolerable skin reaction occur, the cream should be removed by washing the area with mild soap<br />and water. Treatment with imiquimod cream can be resumed after the skin reaction has moderated.<br />The risk of severe local skin reactions may be increased when imiquimod is used at higher than<br />recommended doses (see section 4.2). However, in rare cases severe local reactions that have required<br />treatment and/or caused temporary incapacitation have been observed in patients who have used<br />imiquimod according to the instructions. Where such reactions have occurred at the urethral meatus,<br />some women have experienced difficulty in urinating, sometimes requiring emergency catheterisation<br />and treatment of the affected area.<br />No clinical experience exists with imiquimod cream immediately following treatment with other<br />cutaneously applied drugs for treatment of external genital or perianal warts. Imiquimod cream should<br />be washed from the skin before sexual activity. Imiquimod cream may weaken condoms and<br />diaphragms, therefore concurrent use with imiquimod cream is not recommended. Alternative forms<br />of contraception should be considered.<br />In immunocompromised patients, repeat treatment with imiquimod cream is not recommended.<br />While limited data have shown an increased rate of wart reduction in HIV positive patients,<br />imiquimod cream has not been shown to be as effective in terms of wart clearance in this patient<br />group.<br />Superficial basal cell carcinoma:<br />lmiquimod bas not been evaluated for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma within 1 cm of the<br />eyelids, nose, lips or hairline.<br />During therapy and until healed, affected skin is likely to appear noticeably different from normal<br />skin. Local skin reactions are common but these reactions generally decrease in intensity during<br />therapy or resolve after cessation of imiquimod cream therapy.

The available data on actinic keratosis on the<br />foreanns and hands do not support efficacy in this indication and therefore such use is not<br />recommended.<br />Imiquimod is not recommended for the treatment of AK lesions with marked hyperkeratosis or<br />hypertrophy as seen in cutaneous horns.<br />During therapy and until healed, affected skin is likely to appear noticeably different from normal<br />skin. Local skin reactions are common but these reactions generally decrease in intensity during<br />therapy or resolve after cessation of imiquimod cream therapy. There is an association between the<br />complete clearance rate and the intensity of local skin reactions ( e.g. erythema). These local skin<br />reactions may be related to the stimulation of local immune response. If required by the patient&#39;s<br />discomfort or the intensity of the local skin reaction, a rest period of several days may be taken.<br />Treatment with imiquimod cream can be resumed after the skin reaction has moderated.<br />Each treatment period should not be extended beyond 4 weeks due to missed doses or rest periods.<br />The clinical outcome of therapy can be determined after regeneration of the treated skin,<br />approximately 4-8 weeks after the end of treatment.<br />No clinical experience exists with the use of imiquimod cream in immunocompromised patients.<br />No data are available on re-treating actinic keratoses that have cleared after one or two courses of<br />treatment and subsequently recur, and any such use is therefore not recommended.<br />Data from an open-label clinical trial suggest that subjects with more than 8 AK lesions showed a<br />decreased rate of complete clearance compared to patients with less than 8 lesions.<br />The skin surface area treated should be protected from solar exposure.</p>

These protocol mandated clinical sign assessments indicate that local skin reactions<br />including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excoriation/flaking/scaling (23%) and oedema (14%) were<br />common in these placebo controlled clinical trials with imiquimod cream applied three times weekly<br />(see section 4.4). Local skin reactions, such as erythema, are -probably an extension of the<br />pharmacologic effects of imiquimod cream.<br />Remote site skin reactions, mainly erythema ( 44%), were also reported in the placebo controlled<br />trials. These reactions were at non-wart sites which may have been in contact with imiquimod cream.<br />Most skin reactions were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within 2 weeks of treatment<br />discontinuation. However, in some cases these reactions have been severe, requiring treatment and/or<br />causing incapacitation. In very rare cases, severe reactions at the urethral meatus have resulted in<br />dysuria in women (see section 4.4).<br />Superficial basal cell carcinoma:<br />Investigators of the placebo controlled clinical trials were required to evaluate protocol mandated<br />clinical signs (skin reactions). These protocol mandated clinical sign assessments indicate that severe<br />erythema (31%) severe erosions (13%) and severe scabbing and crusting (19%) were very common in<br />these trials with imiquimod cream applied 5 times weekly. Local skin reactions, such as erythema, are<br />probably an extension of the pharmacologic effect of imiquimod cream.</p><p>Skin infections during treatment with imiquimod have been observed. While serious sequelae have<br />not resulted, the possibility of infection in broken skin should always be considered.<br />Actinic keratosis<br />In clinical trials of imiquimod cream 3 times weekly for 4 or 8 weeks the most frequently occurring<br />application site reactions were itching at the target site (14%) and burning at the target site (5%).<br />Severe erythema (24%) and severe scabbing and crusting (20%) were very common. Local skin<br />reactions, such as erythema, are probably an extension of the pharmacologic effect of irniquimod<br />cream. See 4.2 and 4.4 for information on rest periods.<br />Skin infections during treatment with imiquimod have been observed. While serious sequelae have<br />not resulted, the possibility of infection in broken skin should always be considered.<br />d) Adverse events applicable to all indications:<br />Reports have been received of localised hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation following<br />imiquimod cream use. Follow-up information suggests that these skin colour changes may be<br />permanent in some patients. In a follow-up of 162 patients five years after treatment for sBCC a mild<br />hypopigmentation was observed in 37% of the patients and a moderate hypopigmentation was<br />observed in 6% of the patients. 56% of the patients have been free of hypopigmentation;<br />hyperpigmentation has not been reported.<br />Clinical studies investigating the use of irniquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis have detected<br />a 0.4% (5/1214) frequency of alopecia at the treatment site or surrounding area. Postrnarketing reports<br />of suspected alopecia occurring during the treatment of sBCC and EGW have been received.<br />Reductions in haemoglobin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophils and platelets have been<br />observed in clinical trials. These reductions are not considered to be clinically significant in patients<br />with normal haematologic reserve. Patients with reduced haematologic reserve have not been studied<br />in clinical trials. Reductions in haematological parameters requiring clinical intervention have been<br />reported from postrnarketing experience. There have been postrnarketing reports of elevated liver<br />enzymes.<br />Rare reports have been received of exacerbation of autoimmune conditions.<br />Rare cases of remote site dermatologic drug reactions, including erythema multiforme, have been<br />reported from clinical trials. Serious skin reactions reported from postmarketing experience include<br />erythema multiforme, Stevens Johnson syndrome and cutaneous lupus erythematosus.<br />e) Paediatric population:<br />Imiquimod was investigated in controlled clinical studies with paediatric patients (see sections 4.2<br />and 5.1 ). There was no evidence for systemic reactions. Application site reactions occurred more<br />frequently after imiquimod than after vehicle, however, incidence and intensity of these reactions<br />were not different from that seen in the licensed indications in adults. There was no evidence for<br />serious adverse reaction caused by imiquimod in paediatric patients.<br />Reporting of suspected adverse reactions<br />Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It<br />allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance uf the medicinal &middot;product. Healthcare<br />professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reJ)Orting system<br />listed in Appendix V.</p>

                <p>When applied topically, systemic overdosage with imiquimod cream is unlikely due to minimal<br />percutaneous absorption. Studies in rabbits reveal a dermal lethal dose of greater than 5 g,&#39;kg.<br />Persistent dermal overdosing of imiquimod cream could result in severe local skin reactions.<br />Following accidental ingestion, nausea, emesis, headache, myalgia and fever could occur after a<br />single dose of 200 mg imiquimod which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 sachets. The<br />most clinically serious adverse event reported following multiple oral doses of􀂓 200 mg was<br />hypotension which resolved following oral or intravenous fluid administration.</p>

Saturable binding studies suggest a membrane receptor<br />for imiquimod exists on responding immune cells. Imiquimod has no direct antiviral activity. In<br />animal models imiquimod is effective against viral infections and acts as an antitumour agent<br />principally by induction of alpha interferon and other cytokines. The induction of alpha interferon and<br />other cytokines following imiquimod cream application to genital wart tissue has also been<br />demonstrated in clinical studies.<br />Increases in systemic levels of alpha interferon and other cytokines following topical application of<br />imiquimod were demonstrated in a pharmacokinetic study.<br />External genital warts:<br />Clinical Efficacy<br />The results of 3 phase III pivotal efficacy studies showed that treatment with imiquimod for sixteen<br />weeks was significantly more effective than treatment with vehicle as measured by total clearance of<br />treated warts.<br />In 119 imiquimod-treated female patients, the combined total clearance rate was 60% as compared to<br />20% in I 05 vehicle-treated patients (95% CI for rate difference: 20% to 61 o/o, p&lt;0.001).

These results were statistically significant (p&lt;0.00 I) by comparison with the<br />vehicle group, 3% (6/179) and 2% (3/179) respectively. There was a significant association between<br />the intensity of local skin reactions ( e.g. erythema) seen during the treatment period and complete<br />clearance of the basal cell carcinoma.<br />Five -year data from a long-term open-label uncontrolled study indicate that an estimated 77.9%<br />[95% Cl (71.9%, 83.8%)] of all the subjects who initially received treatment became clinically clear<br />and remained clear at 60 months.</p><p>Actinic keratosis:<br />Clinical efficacy:<br />The efficacy of imiquimod applied 3 times per week for one or two courses of 4 weeks, separated by a<br />4 week treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind vehicle controlled clinical trials.<br />Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, nonhyperkeratotic, nonhypertrophic AK lesions on the<br />balding scalp or face within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area. 4-8 AK lesions were treated. The<br />complete clearance rate (imiquimod minus placebo) for the combined trials was 46.1 % (Cl 39.0%,<br />53.1%).<br />One-year data from two combined observational studies indicate a recurrence rate of 27%<br />(35/128 patients) in those patients who became clinically clear after one or two courses of treatment.<br />The recurrence rate for individual lesions was 5.6% (41/737). Corresponding recurrence rates for<br />vehicle were 47% (8/17 patients) and 7.5% (6/80 lesions). The rate of progression to squamous cell<br />carcinoma (SCC) was reported in 1.6% (2/128 patients).<br />There are no data on recurrence and pro gression rates beyond 1 year.<br />Paediatric population<br />The approved indications genital warts, actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma are<br />conditions not generally seen within the paediatric population and were not studied.<br />Aldara Cream has been evaluated in four randomised, vehicle controlled, double-blind trials in<br />children aged 2 to 15 years with molluscum contagiosum (imiquimod n = 576, vehicle n = 313).<br />These trials failed to demonstrate efficacy of imiquimod at any of the tested dosage regimens<br />(3x/week for 􀂝16 weeks and 7x/week for 􀂝8 weeks).</p>

                <p>External genital warts, superficial basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis:<br />Less than 0.9% of a topically applied single dose of radiolabelled imiquimod was absorbed through<br />the skin of human subjects. The small amount of drug which was absorbed into the systemic<br />circulation was promptly excreted by both urinary and faecal routes at a mean ratio of approximately<br />3 to 1. No quantifiable levels (&gt;5 ng/ml) of drug were detected in serum after single or multiple<br />topical doses.<br />Systemic exposure (percutaneous penetration) was calculated from recovery of carbon-14 from [ I 4C]<br />imiquimod in urine and faeces.</p><p>scalp and hands/ anns groups. Dose proportionality was not observed. An apparent half-life was<br />calculated that was approximately 10 times greater than the 2 hour half-life seen following<br />subcutaneous dosing in a previous study, suggesting prolonged retention of drug in the skin. Urinary<br />recovery was less than 0.6% of the applied dose at week 16 in these patients.<br />Paediatric population<br />The pharmacokinetic properties of imiquimod following single and multiple topical application in<br />paediatric patients with molluscum contagiosurn (MC) have been investigated. The systemic exposure<br />data demonstrated that the extent of absorption of imiquimod following topical application to the MC<br />lesional skin of the paediatric patients aged 6-12 years was low and comparable to that observed in<br />healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficial basal cell carcinoma. In younger patients<br />aged 2-5 years absorption, based on C,nax values, was higher compared to adults.</p>

                <p>Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety<br />pharmacology, mutagenicity and teratogenicity.<br />In a four-month rat dermal toxicity study, significantly decreased body weight and increased spleen<br />weight were observed at 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg; similar effects were not seen in a four month mouse<br />dermal study. Local dermal irritation, especially at higher doses, was observed in both species.<br />A two-year mouse carcinogenicity study by dermal administration on three days a week did not<br />induce tumours at the application site. However, the incidences of hepatocellular tumours among<br />treated animals were greater than those for controls. The mechanism for this is not known, but as<br />imiquimod has low systemic absorption from human skin, and is not mutagenic, any risk to humans<br />from systemic exposure is likely to be low. Furthermore, tumours were not seen at any site in a 2-year<br />oral carcinogenicity study in rats.<br />hniquimod cream was evaluated in a photocarcinogenicity bioassay in alhino hairless mice exposed to<br />simulated solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Animals were administered imiquimod cream three ti.mes<br />per week and were irradiated 5 days per week for 40 weeks. Mice were maintained for an additional<br />12 weeks for a total of 52 weeks. Tumours occurred earlier and in greater number in the group of<br />mice administered the vehicle cream in comparison with the low UVR control group. The significance<br />for man is unknown.
