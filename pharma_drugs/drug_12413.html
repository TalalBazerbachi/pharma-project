The antihypertensive effect is substantially present within 2 weeks, and maximal effects are attained within 4 weeks. In some patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled, the dose can be increased to 160 mg and to a maximum of 320 mg.</p><p><strong>Avysk<sup>&reg; </sup></strong>may also be administered with other antihypertensive agents (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). The addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide will decrease blood pressure even further in these patients.</p><p><u>Recent myocardial infarction </u></p><p>In clinically stable patients, therapy may be initiated as early as 12 hours after a myocardial infarction. After an initial dose of 20 mg twice daily, valsartan should be titrated to 40 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg twice daily over the next few weeks. The starting dose is provided by the 40 mg divisible.</p><p>The target maximum dose is 160 mg twice daily. In general, it is recommended that patients achieve a dose level of 80 mg twice daily by two weeks after treatment initiation and that the target maximum dose, 160 mg twice daily, be achieved by three months, based on the patient&#39;s tolerability. If symptomatic hypotension or renal dysfunction occur, consideration should be given to a dose reduction.</p><p>Valsartan may be used in patients treated with other post-myocardial infarction therapies, e.g. thrombolytics, acetylsalicylic acid, beta blockers, statins, and diuretics. The combination with ACE inhibitors is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).</p><p>Evaluation of post-myocardial infarction patients should always include assessment of renal function.</p><p><u>Heart failure </u></p><p>The recommended starting dose of valsartan is 40 mg twice daily. Up titration to 80 mg and 160 mg twice daily should be done at intervals of at least two weeks to the highest dose, as tolerated by the patient. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretics. The maximum daily dose administered in clinical trials is 320 mg in divided doses.</p><p>Valsartan may be administered with other heart failure therapies. However, the triple combination of an ACE inhibitor, valsartan and a beta blocker or a potassium-sparing diuretic is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).</p><p>Evaluation of patients with heart failure should always include assessment of renal function.</p><p><em><u>Additional information on special populations </u></em></p><p><u>Older people </u></p><p>No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients.</p><p><u>Patients with Renal impairment </u></p><p>No dose adjustment is required for adult patients with a creatinine clearance &gt;10 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).</p><p><u>Patients with Hepatic impairment </u></p><p><strong>Avysk<sup>&reg; </sup></strong>is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and in patients with cholestasis (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.</p><p>AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia); see also section 5.3 &ldquo;Preclinical safety data&rdquo;.</p><p>Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.</p><p>Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see also sections 4.3 and 4.4).</p><p><em><u>Breast-feeding </u></em></p><p>Because no information is available regarding the use of valsartan during breastfeeding, <strong>Avysk<sup>&reg; </sup></strong>is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.</p><p><em><u>Fertility </u></em></p><p>Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).</p>

These studies included 711 paediatric patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD), of which 560 patients received valsartan. With the exception of isolated gastrointestinal disorders (such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting) and dizziness, no relevant differences in terms of type, frequency and severity of adverse reactions were identified between the safety profile for paediatric patients aged 6 to less than 18 years and that previously reported for adult patients.</p><p>Neurocognitive and developmental assessment of paediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years of age revealed no overall clinically relevant adverse impact after treatment with valsartan for up to one year.</p><p>A pooled analysis of 560 paediatric hypertensive patients (aged 6-17 years) receiving either valsartan monotherapy [n=483] or combination antihypertensive therapy including valsartan [n=77] was conducted. Of the 560 patients, 85 (15.2%) had CKD (baseline GFR &lt;90 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Overall, 45 (8.0%) patients discontinued a study due to adverse events. Overall 111 (19.8%) patients experienced an adverse drug reaction (ADR), with headache (5.4%), dizziness (2.3%), and hyperkalaemia (2.3%) being the most frequent. In patients with CKD, the most frequent ADRs were hyperkalaemia (12.9%), headache (7.1%), blood creatinine increased (5.9%), and hypotension (4.7%). In patients without CKD, the most frequent ADRs were headache (5.1%) and dizziness (2.7%). ADRs were observed more frequently in patients receiving valsartan in combination with other antihypertensive medications than valsartan alone.</p><p>The antihypertensive effect of valsartan in children 1 to less than 6 years of age has been evaluated in three randomised, double-blind clinical studies (each followed by an extension period). In the first study in 90 children aged 1 to less than 6 years, two deaths and isolated cases of marked liver transaminases elevations were observed. These cases occurred in a population who had significant comorbidities. A causal relationship to valsartan has not been established. In the two subsequent studies in which 202 children aged 1 to less than 6 years were randomised, no significant liver transaminase elevations or death occurred with valsartan treatment.</p><p>In a pooled analysis of the two subsequent studies in 202 hypertensive children (aged 1 to less than 6 years), all patients received valsartan monotherapy in the double blind periods (excluding the placebo withdrawal period). Of these, 186 patients continued in either extension study or open label period. Of the 202 patients, 33 (16.3%) had CKD (baseline eGFR &lt;90 ml/min). In the double blind period, two patients (1%) discontinued due to an adverse event and in the open label or extension period four patients (2.1%) discontinued due to an adverse event. In the double blind period, 13 (7.0%) patients experienced at least one ADR. The most frequent ADRs were vomiting n=3 (1.6%) and diarrhea n=2 (1.1%). There was one ADR (diarrhoea) in the CKD group. In the open label period, 5.4% patients (10/186) had at least one ADR. The most frequent ADR was decreased appetite which was reported by two patients (1.1%). In both the double blind period and the open label periods, hyperkalaemia was reported for one patient in each period. There were no cases of hypotension or dizziness in either double blind or open label periods.</p><p>Hyperkalaemia was more frequently observed in children and adolescents aged 1 to less than 18 years with underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD). The risk of hyperkalaemia may be higher in children aged 1 to 5 years compared to children aged 6 to less than 18 years.</p><p>The safety profile seen in controlled-clinical studies in adult patients with post-myocardial infarction and/or heart failure varies from the overall safety profile seen in hypertensive patients.

                <p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC code: C09CA03</p><p>Valsartan is an orally active, potent, and specific angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist. It acts selectively on the AT1 receptor subtype, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. The increased plasma levels of Ang II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked AT2 receptor, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 receptor. Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much (about 20,000 fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Valsartan is not known to bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.</p><p>Valsartan does not inhibit ACE (also known as kininase II) which converts Ang I to Ang II and degrades bradykinin. Since there is no effect on ACE and no potentiation of bradykinin or substance P, angiotensin II antagonists are unlikely to be associated with coughing. In clinical trials where valsartan was compared with an ACE inhibitor, the incidence of dry cough was significantly (p&lt;0.05) less in patients treated with valsartan than in those treated with an ACE inhibitor (2.6% versus 7.9% respectively). In a clinical trial of patients with a history of dry</p><p>cough during ACE inhibitor therapy, 19.5% of trial subjects receiving valsartan and 19.0% of those receiving a thiazide diuretic experienced cough compared to 68.5% of those treated with an ACE inhibitor (p&lt;0.05).</p><p><strong><u>Hypertension</u></strong></p><p>Administration of <strong>Avysk<sup>&reg; </sup></strong>to patients with hypertension results in reduction of blood pressure without affecting pulse rate.</p><p>In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 2 hours, and the peak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 4-6 hours. The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after dosing. During repeated dosing, the antihypertensive effect is substantially present within 2 weeks, and maximal effects are attained within 4 weeks and persist during long-term therapy. Combined with hydrochlorothiazide, a significant additional reduction in blood pressure is achieved.</p><p>Abrupt withdrawal of valsartan has not been associated with rebound hypertension or other adverse clinical events.</p><p>In hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, valsartan has been shown to reduce the urinary excretion of albumin. The MARVAL (Micro Albuminuria Reduction with Valsartan) study assessed the reduction in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) with valsartan (80-160 mg/od) versus amlodipine (5-10 mg/od), in 332 type 2 diabetic patients (mean age: 58 years; 265 men) with microalbuminuria (valsartan: 58 micrograms/min; amlodipine: 55.4 micrograms/min), normal or high blood pressure and with preserved renal function (blood creatinine &lt;120 micromols/l). At 24 weeks, UAE was reduced (p&lt;0.001) by 42% (&ndash;24.2 micrograms/min; 95% CI: &ndash;40.4 to &ndash;19.1) with valsartan and approximately 3% (&ndash;1.7 micrograms/min; 95% CI: &ndash;5.6 to 14.9) with amlodipine despite similar rates of blood pressure reduction in both groups.</p><p>The valasrtan Reduction of Proteinuria study further examined the efficacy of valsartan in reducing UAE in 391 hypertensive patients (BP=150/88 mmHg) with type 2 diabetes, albuminuria (mean=102 micrograms/min; 20-700 micrograms/min) and preserved renal function (mean serum creatinine = 80 micromols/l). Patients were randomized to one of 3 doses of valsartan (160, 320 and 640 mg/od) and treated for 30 weeks. The purpose of the study was to determine the optimal dose of valsartan for reducing UAE in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. At 30 weeks, the percentage change in UAE was significantly reduced by 36% from baseline with valsartan 160 mg (95%CI: 22 to 47%), and by 44% with valsartan 320 mg (95%CI: 31 to 54%). It was concluded that 160-320 mg of valsartan produced clinically relevant reductions in UAE in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p><strong><u>Recent myocardial infarction</u></strong></p><p>The VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion trial (VALIANT) was a randomised, controlled, multinational, double-blind study in 14,703 patients with acute myocardial infarction and signs, symptoms or radiological evidence of congestive heart failure and/or evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (manifested as an ejection fraction &le;40% by radionuclide ventriculography or &le;35% by echocardiography or ventricular contrast angiography). Patients were randomised within 12 hours to 10 days after the onset of myocardial infarction symptoms to valsartan, captopril, or the combination of both. The mean treatment duration was two years. The primary endpoint was time to all-cause mortality.</p><p>Valsartan was as effective as captopril in reducing all-cause mortality after myocardial infarction. All-cause mortality was similar in the valsartan (19.9%), captopril (19.5%), and valsartan + captopril (19.3%) groups. Combining valsartan with captopril did not add further benefit over captopril alone. There was no difference between valsartan and captopril in all-cause mortality based on age, gender, race, baseline therapies or underlying disease. Valsartan was also effective in prolonging the time to and reducing cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and non-fatal stroke (secondary composite endpoint).</p><p>The safety profile of valsartan was consistent with the clinical course of patients treated in the post-myocardial infarction setting. Regarding renal function, doubling of serum creatinine was observed in 4.2% of valsartan-treated patients, 4.8% of valsartan+captopril-treated patients, and 3.4% of captopril-treated patients. Discontinuations due to various types of renal dysfunction occurred in 1.1% of valsartan-treated patients, 1.3% in valsartan+captopril patients, and 0.8% of captopril patients. An assessment of renal function should be included in the evaluation of patients post-myocardial infarction.</p><p>There was no difference in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or morbidity when beta blockers were administered together with the combination of valsartan + captopril, valsartan alone, or captopril alone. Irrespective of treatment, mortality was lower in the group of patients treated with a beta blocker, suggesting that the known beta blocker benefit in this population was maintained in this trial.</p><p><strong><u>Heart failure</u></strong></p><p>Val-HeFT was a randomised, controlled, multinational clinical trial of valsartan compared with placebo on morbidity and mortality in 5,010 NYHA class II (62%), III (36%) and IV (2%) heart failure patients receiving usual therapy with LVEF &lt;40% and left ventricular internal diastolic diameter (LVIDD) &gt;2.9 cm/m2. Baseline therapy included ACE inhibitors (93%), diuretics (86%), digoxin (67%) and beta blockers (36%). The mean duration of follow-up was nearly two years. The mean daily dose of valsartan in Val-HeFT was 254 mg. The study had two primary endpoints: all cause mortality (time to death) and composite mortality and heart failure morbidity (time to first morbid event) defined as death, sudden death with resuscitation, hospitalisation for heart failure, or administration of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator agents for four hours or more without hospitalisation.</p><p>All cause mortality was similar (p=NS) in the valsartan (19.7%) and placebo (19.4%) groups. The primary benefit was a 27.5% (95% CI: 17 to 37%) reduction in risk for time to first heart failure hospitalisation (13.9% vs. 18.5%). Results appearing to favour placebo (composite mortality and morbidity was 21.9% in placebo vs. 25.4% in valsartan group) were observed for those patients receiving the triple combination of an ACE inhibitor, a beta blocker and valsartan.</p><p>In a subgroup of patients not receiving an ACE inhibitor (n=366), the morbidity benefits were greatest. In this subgroup all-cause mortality was significantly reduced with valsartan compared to placebo by 33% (95% CI: &ndash;6% to 58%) (17.3% valsartan vs. 27.1% placebo) and the composite mortality and morbidity risk was significantly reduced by 44% (24.9% valsartan vs. 42.5% placebo).</p><p>In patients receiving an ACE inhibitor without a beta-blocker, all cause mortality was similar (p=NS) in the valsartan (21.8%) and placebo (22.5%) groups. Composite mortality and morbidity risk was significantly reduced by 18.3% (95% CI: 8% to 28%) with valsartan compared with placebo (31.0% vs. 36.3%).</p><p>In the overall Val-HeFT population, valsartan treated patients showed significant improvement in NYHA class, and heart failure signs and symptoms, including dyspnoea, fatigue, oedema and rales compared to placebo. Patients treated with valsartan had a better quality of life as demonstrated by change in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Quality of Life score from baseline at endpoint than placebo. Ejection fraction in valsartan treated patients was significantly increased and LVIDD significantly reduced from baseline at endpoint compared to placebo.</p><p><strong><u>Other: dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)</u></strong></p><p>Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor blocker.</p><p>ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant for other ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.</p><p>ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group.</p><p><em><u>Paediatric population</u></em></p><p><u>Hypertension</u></p><p>The antihypertensive effect of valsartan have been evaluated in four randomized, double-blind clinical studies in 561 paediatric patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age and 165 paediatric patients 1 to 6 years of age. Renal and urinary disorders, and obesity were the most common underlying medical conditions potentially contributing to hypertension in the children enrolled in these studies.</p><p><em><u>Clinical experience in children at or above 6 years of age</u></em></p><p>In a clinical study involving 261 hypertensive paediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age, patients who weighed &lt;35 kg received 10, 40 or 80 mg of valsartan daily (low, medium and high doses), and patients who weighed &ge;35 kg received 20, 80, and 160 mg of valsartan daily (low, medium and high doses). At the end of 2 weeks, valsartan reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, the three dose levels of valsartan (low, medium and high) significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 8, 10, 12 mm Hg from the baseline, respectively. Patients were re-randomized to either continue receiving the same dose of valsartan or were switched to placebo. In patients who continued to receive the medium and high doses of valsartan, systolic blood pressure at trough was -4 and -7 mm Hg lower than patients who received the placebo treatment. In patients receiving the low dose of valsartan, systolic blood pressure at trough was similar to that of patients who received the placebo treatment. Overall, the dose-dependent antihypertensive effect of valsartan was consistent across all the demographic subgroups.</p><p>In a second clinical study involving 300 hypertensive paediatric patients 6 to less than 18 years of age, eligible patients were randomized to receive valsartan or enalapril tablets for 12 weeks. Children weighing between &ge;18 kg and &lt;35 kg received valsartan 80 mg or enalapril 10 mg; those between &ge;35 kg and &lt;80 kg received valsartan 160 mg or enalapril 20 mg; those &ge;80 kg received valsartan 320 mg or enalapril 40 mg. Reductions in systolic blood pressure were comparable in patients receiving valsartan (15 mmHg) and enalapril (14 mm Hg) (non-inferiority p-value &lt;0.0001). Consistent results were observed for diastolic blood pressure with reductions of 9.1 mmHg and 8.5 mmHg with valsartan and enalapril, respectively.</p><p>In a third, open label clinical study, involving 150 paediatric hypertensive patients 6 to 17 years of age, eligible patients (systolic BP &ge;95th percentile for age, gender and height) received valsartan for 18 months to evaluate safety and tolerability. Out of the 150 patients participating in this study, 41 patients also received concomitant antihypertensive medication. Patients were dosed based on their weight categories for starting and maintenance doses. Patients weighing &gt;18 to &lt; 35 kg, &ge;35 to &lt; 80 kg and &ge; 80 to &lt; 160 kg received 40 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg and the doses were titrated to 80 mg, 160 mg and 320 mg respectively after one week. One half of the patients enrolled (50.0%, n=75) had CKD with 29.3% (44) of patients having CKD Stage 2 (GFR 60 &ndash; 89 mL/min/1.73m2) or Stage 3 (GFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2). Mean reductions in systolic blood pressure were 14.9 mmHg in all patients (baseline 133.5 mmHg), 18.4 mmHg in patients with CKD (baseline 131.9 mmHg) and 11.5 mmHg in patients without CKD (baseline 135.1 mmHg). The percentage of patients who achieved overall BP control (both systolic and diastolic BP &lt;95th percentile) was slightly higher in the CKD group (79.5%) compared to the non-CKD group (72.2%).</p><p><em><u>&nbsp;</u></em></p><p><em><u>Clinical experience in children less than 6 years of age</u></em></p><p>Three clinical studies were conducted in 291 patients aged 1 to 5 years. No children below the age of 1 year were enrolled in these studies.</p><p>In the first study, of 90 patients, dose-response could not be demonstratedbut inthe second study of 75 patients, higher doses of valsartan were associated with greater blood pressure reductions.</p><p>The third study was a 6 week, randomised double-blind study to evaluate the dose response of valsartan in 126 children aged 1 to 5 years with hypertension, with or without CKD randomised to either 0.25 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg body weight. At endpoint, the reduction in Mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP)/ Mean diastolic blood pressure (MDBP) with valsartan 4.0 mg/kg compared to valsartan 0.25 mg/kg was 8.5/6.8 mmHg and 4.1/0.3 mmHg, respectively; (p=0.0157/p&lt;0.0001). Similarly the CKD subgroup also showed reductions in MSBP/MDBP with valsartan 4.0 mg/kg compared to 0.25 mg/kg (9.2/6.5 mmHg vs 1.2/ +1.3 mmHg.</p><p>The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with valsartan in all subsets of the paediatric population in heart failure and heart failure after recent myocardial infarction.

                <p><em><u>Absorption:</u></em></p><p>Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached in 2&ndash;4 hours with tablets and 1-2 hours with solution formulation. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23% and 39% with tablets and solution formulation, respectively. The systemic exposure and peak plasma concentration of valsartan is about 1.7-fold and 2.2-fold higher with the solution compared to the tablets.</p><p>Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups. This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food.</p><p><em><u>Distribution:</u></em></p><p>The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (94&ndash;97%), mainly serum albumin.</p><p><em><u>Biotransformation:</u></em></p><p>Valsartan is not biotransformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is recovered as metabolites. A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive.</p><p><em><u>Elimination:</u></em></p><p>Valsartan shows multiexponential decay kinetics (t&frac12;&alpha; &lt;1 h and t&frac12;&szlig; about 9 h). Valsartan is primarily eliminated by biliary excretion in faeces (about 83% of dose) and renally in urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug. Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/h (about 30% of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours.</p><p><u>In heart failure patients:</u></p><p>The average time to peak concentration and elimination half-life of valsartan in heart failure patients are similar to that observed in healthy volunteers. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan are almost proportional with increasing dose over the clinical dosing range (40 to 160 mg twice a day). The average accumulation factor is about 1.7. The apparent clearance of valsartan following oral administration is approximately 4.5 l/h. Age does not affect the apparent clearance in heart failure patients.</p><p><em><u>Special populations</u></em></p><p><u>Older people</u></p><p>A somewhat higher systemic exposure to valsartan was observed in some elderly subjects than in young subjects; however, this has not been shown to have any clinical significance.</p><p><u>Impaired renal function</u></p><p>As expected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan. Dose adjustment is therefore not required in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance &gt;10 ml/min). There is currently no experience on the safe use in patients with a creatinine clearance &lt;10 ml/min and patients undergoing dialysis, therefore valsartan should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Valsartan is highly bound to plasma protein and is unlikely to be removed by dialysis.</p><p><u>Hepatic impairment</u></p><p>Approximately 70% of the dose absorbed is eliminated in the bile, essentially in the unchanged form. Valsartan does not undergo any noteworthy biotransformation. A doubling of exposure (AUC) was observed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. However, no correlation was observed between plasma valsartan concentration versus degree of hepatic dysfunction. Valsartan has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).</p><p><em><u>Paediatric population</u></em></p><p>In a study of 26 paediatric hypertensive patients (aged 1 to 16 years) given a single dose of a suspension of valsartan (mean: 0.9 to 2 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 80 mg), the clearance</p><p>(litres/h/kg) of valsartan was comparable across the age range of 1 to 16 years and similar to that of adults receiving the same formulation (see Absorption information under section 5.2).</p><p><u>Impaired renal function</u></p><p>Use in paediatric patients with a creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min and paediatric patients undergoing dialysis has not been studied, therefore valsartan is not recommended in these patients. No dose adjustment is required for paediatric patients with a creatinine clearance &gt;30 ml/min. Renal function and serum potassium should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p>

                <p>Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential.</p><p>In rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to lower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) in the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).</p><p>In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of changes in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised plasma urea, and renal tubular hyperplasia and basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60-kg patient).</p><p>In marmosets at similar doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the kidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy which included raised urea and creatinine.</p><p>Hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were considered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged hypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance.</p><p><em><u>Paediatric population</u></em></p><p>Daily oral dosing of neonatal/juvenile rats (from a postnatal day 7 to postnatal day 70) with valsartan at doses as low as 1 mg/kg/day (about 10-35% of the maximum recommended paediatric dose of 4 mg/kg/day on systemic exposure basis) produced persistent, irreversible kidney damage. These effects above mentioned represent an expected exaggerated pharmacological effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 blockers; such effects are observed if rats are treated during the first 13 days of life. This period coincides with 36 weeks of gestation in humans, which could occasionally extend up to 44 weeks after conception in humans. The rats in the juvenile valsartan study were dosed up to day 70, and effects on renal maturation (postnatal 4-6 weeks) cannot be excluded. Functional renal maturation is an ongoing process within the first year of life in humans. Consequently, a clinical relevance in children &lt;1 year of age cannot be excluded, while preclinical data do not indicate a safety concern for children older than 1 year.</p>
