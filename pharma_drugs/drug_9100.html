There is an increased risk of bleeding if romiplostim treatment is discontinued in the presence of anticoagulants or anti-platelet agents. Patients should be closely monitored for a decrease in platelet count and medically managed to avoid bleeding upon discontinuation of treatment with romiplostim. It is recommended that, if treatment with romiplostim is discontinued, ITP treatment be restarted according to current treatment guidelines. Additional medical management may include cessation of anticoagulant and/or anti‑platelet therapy, reversal of anticoagulation, or platelet support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Increased bone marrow reticulin</u></p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>Increased bone marrow reticulin is believed to be a result of TPO receptor stimulation, leading to an increased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, which may subsequently release cytokines. Increased reticulin may be suggested by morphological changes in the peripheral blood cells and can be detected through bone marrow biopsy. Therefore, examinations for cellular morphological abnormalities using peripheral blood smear and complete blood count (CBC) prior to and during treatment with romiplostim are recommended. See section 4.8 for information on the increases of reticulin observed in romiplostim clinical trials.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If a loss of efficacy and abnormal peripheral blood smear is observed in patients, administration of romiplostim should be discontinued, a physical examination should be performed, and a bone marrow biopsy with appropriate staining for reticulin should be considered. If available, comparison to a prior bone marrow biopsy should be made. If efficacy is maintained and abnormal peripheral blood smear is observed in patients, the physician should follow appropriate clinical judgment, including consideration of a bone marrow biopsy, and the risk-benefit of romiplostim and alternative ITP treatment options should be re-assessed.</p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p><u>Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Platelet counts above the normal range present a risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications. The incidence of thrombotic/thromboembolic events observed in clinical trials was 6.0% with romiplostim and 3.6% with placebo. Caution should be used when administering romiplostim to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism including but not limited to inherited (e.g. Factor V Leiden) or acquired risk factors (e.g. ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome), advanced age, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, malignancies, contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, surgery/trauma, obesity and smoking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cases of thromboembolic events (TEEs), including portal vein thrombosis, have been reported in patients with chronic liver disease receiving romiplostim. Romiplostim should be used with caution in these populations. Dose adjustment guidelines should be followed (see section 4.2).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Medication errors</u></p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>Medication errors including overdose and underdose have been reported in patients receiving Nplate, dose calculation and dose adjustment guidelines should be followed. In some paediatric patients, accurate dosing relies on an additional dilution step after reconstitution which may increase the risk for medication errors (see section 4.2).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overdose may result in an excessive increase in platelet counts associated with thrombotic/thromboembolic complications. If the platelet counts are excessively increased, discontinue Nplate and monitor platelet counts. Reinitiate treatment with Nplate in accordance with dosing and administration recommendations. Underdose may result in lower than expected platelet counts and potential for bleeding. Platelet counts should be monitored in patients receiving Nplate (see&nbsp;sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.9).</p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p><u>Progression of existing Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A positive benefit/risk for romiplostim is only established for the treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with ITP (see section&nbsp;4.1) and romiplostim must not be used in other clinical conditions associated with thrombocytopenia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The diagnosis of ITP in adults and elderly patients should have been confirmed by the exclusion of other clinical entities presenting with thrombocytopenia, in particular the diagnosis of MDS must be excluded. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should normally have been done over the course of the disease and treatment, particularly in patients over 60&nbsp;years of age, for those with systemic symptoms or abnormal signs such as increased peripheral blast cells.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In adult clinical studies of treatment with romiplostim in patients with MDS, cases of transient increases in blast cell counts were observed and cases of MDS disease progression to AML were reported. In a randomised placebo-controlled trial in MDS subjects, treatment with romiplostim was prematurely stopped due to a numerical excess of disease progression to AML and an increase in circulating blasts greater than 10% in patients receiving romiplostim. Of the cases of MDS disease progression to AML that were observed, patients with RAEB-1 classification of MDS at baseline were more likely to have disease progression to AML compared to lower risk MDS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romiplostim must not be used for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS or any other cause of thrombocytopenia other than ITP outside of clinical trials.</p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p><u>Loss of response to romiplostim</u></p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>A loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim treatment within the recommended dosing range should prompt a search for causative factors, including immunogenicity (see section 4.8) and increased bone marrow reticulin (see above).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Effects of romiplostim on red and white blood cells</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alterations in red (decrease) and white (increase) blood cell parametres have been observed in non‑clinical toxicology studies (rat and monkey) as well as in ITP patients. Concurrent anaemia and leucocytosis (within a 4-week window) may occur in patients regardless of splenectomy status, but have been seen more often in patients who have had a prior splenectomy. Monitoring of these parametres should be considered in patients treated with romiplostim.</p>

romiplostim was similar across adult patients, regardless of ITP duration. Specifically in the integrated analysis of ITP&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;12&nbsp;months duration (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;311), 277 adult patients with ITP&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;12&nbsp;months duration and who received at least one dose of romiplostim from among those patients in 9 ITP studies were included (see also section 5.1). In this integrated analysis, the following adverse reactions (at least 5% incidence and at least 5% more frequent with Nplate compared with placebo or standard of care) occurred in romiplostim patients with ITP duration up to 12&nbsp;months, but were not observed in those adult patients with ITP duration &gt;&nbsp;12&nbsp;months: bronchitis, sinusitis (reported commonly (&ge;&nbsp;1/100 to &lt;&nbsp;1/10)).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Paediatric population</u></p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>In the paediatric studies, 282 paediatric ITP subjects were treated with romiplostim in 2 controlled and 3 uncontrolled clinical trials. The median duration of exposure was 65.4 weeks. The overall safety profile was similar to that seen in adults.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The paediatric adverse reactions are derived from each of the paediatric ITP randomised safety set (2 controlled clinical trials) and paediatric ITP safety set (2 controlled and 3 uncontrolled clinical trials) where the subject incidence was at least 5% higher in the romiplostim arm compared to placebo and at least a 5% subject incidence in romiplostim-treated subjects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most common adverse reactions in paediatric ITP patients 1 year and older were upper respiratory tract infection, rhinitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia, contusion (reported very commonly (&ge;&nbsp;1/10)), and pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, ear infection, gastroenteritis, sinusitis, purpura, urticaria and peripheral swelling (reported commonly (&sup3;&nbsp;1/100 to &lt;&nbsp;1/10)).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, rhinitis, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, ear infection, sinusitis and peripheral swelling were additional adverse reactions observed in paediatric studies compared to those seen in adult studies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the adverse reactions seen in adults were reported more frequently in paediatric subjects such as cough, diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia and contusion reported very commonly (&ge;&nbsp;1/10) in paediatric subjects and purpura and urticaria were reported commonly (&sup3;&nbsp;1/100 to &lt;&nbsp;1/10) in paediatric subjects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Description of selected adverse reactions</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the reactions listed below have been deemed to be related to romiplostim treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Bleeding events </em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Across the entire adult ITP clinical programme an inverse relationship between bleeding events and platelet counts was observed. All clinically significant (&ge;&nbsp;grade&nbsp;3) bleeding events occurred at platelet counts &lt;&nbsp;30&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>/L. All bleeding events &ge;&nbsp;grade&nbsp;2 occurred at platelet counts &lt;&nbsp;50&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>/L. No statistically significant differences in the overall incidence of bleeding events were observed between Nplate and placebo treated patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the two adult placebo-controlled studies, 9 patients reported a bleeding event that was considered serious (5 [6.0%] romiplostim, 4 [9.8%] placebo; Odds Ratio [romiplostim/placebo]&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.59; 95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;(0.15, 2.31)). Bleeding events that were grade 2 or higher were reported by 15% of patients treated with romiplostim and 34% of patients treated with placebo (Odds Ratio; [romiplostim/placebo]&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.35; 95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;(0.14, 0.85)).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the Phase 3 paediatric study, the mean (SD) number of composite bleeding episodes (see section 5.1) was 1.9 (4.2) for the romiplostim arm and 4.0 (6.9) for the placebo arm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Thrombocytosis</em></p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>Based on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled clinical trials, 3 events of thrombocytosis were reported, n&nbsp;=&nbsp;271. No clinical sequelae were reported in association with the elevated platelet counts in any of the 3&nbsp;subjects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thrombocytosis in paediatric subjects occurred uncommonly (&sup3;&nbsp;1/1,000 to &lt;&nbsp;1/100), with a subject incidence of 1 (0.4%). Subject incidence was 1 (0.4%) for either grade &ge; 3 or serious thrombocytosis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Thrombocytopenia after cessation of treatment </em></p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>Based on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled clinical trials, 4 events of thrombocytopenia after cessation of treatment were reported, n&nbsp;=&nbsp;271 (see&nbsp;section 4.4).</p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p><em>Progression of existing Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)</em></p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>In a randomised placebo-controlled trial in MDS adult subjects treatment with romiplostim was prematurely stopped due to a numerical increase in cases of MDS disease progression to AML and transient increases in blast cell counts in patients treated with romiplostim compared to placebo. Of the cases of MDS disease progression to AML that were observed, patients with RAEB-1 classification of MDS at baseline were more likely to have disease progression to AML (see section 4.4). Overall survival was similar to placebo.</p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p><em>Increased bone marrow reticulin</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In adult clinical trials, romiplostim treatment was discontinued in 4 of the 271&nbsp;patients because of bone marrow reticulin deposition. In 6 additional patients reticulin was observed upon bone marrow biopsy (see section 4.4).</p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>In a paediatric clinical trial (see section 5.1), of the subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsy, 5 out of 27 subjects (18.5%) developed increased reticulin at year&nbsp;1 after exposure to romiplostim (cohort 1) and 17 out of 36 subjects (47.2%) developed increased reticulin at year&nbsp;2 after exposure to romiplostim (cohort 2). However, no subject showed any bone marrow abnormalities that were inconsistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP at baseline or on-treatment.</p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p><em>Immunogenicity</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Clinical trials in adult ITP patients examined antibodies to romiplostim and TPO.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While 5.7% (60/1,046) and 3.2% (33/1,046) of the subjects were positive for developing binding antibodies to romiplostim and TPO respectively, only 4&nbsp;subjects were positive for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim but these antibodies did not cross react with endogenous TPO. Of the 4&nbsp;subjects, 2 subjects tested negative for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim at the subject&rsquo;s last timepoint (transient positive) and 2&nbsp;subjects remained positive at the subject&rsquo;s last timepoint (persistent antibodies). The incidence of pre‑existing antibodies to romiplostim and TPO was 3.3% (35/1,046) and 3.0% (31/1,046), respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In paediatric studies, the incidence of binding antibodies to romiplostim at any time was 9.6% (27/282). Of the 27 subjects, 2 subjects had pre-existing binding non-neutralising romiplostim antibodies at baseline. Additionally, 2.8% (8/282) developed neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. A total of 3.9% (11/282) subjects had binding antibodies to TPO at any time during romiplostim treatment. Of these 11 subjects, 2 subjects had pre-existing binding non-neutralising antibodies to TPO. One subject (0.35%) had a weakly positive postbaseline result for neutralising antibodies against TPO while on-study (consistently negative for anti-romiplostim antibodies) with a negative result at baseline. The subject showed a transient antibody response for neutralising antibodies against TPO, with a negative result at the subject&rsquo;s last timepoint tested within the study period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the post-marketing registry study, 19 confirmed paediatric patients were included. The incidence of binding antibody post‑treatment was 16% (3/19) to romiplostim, of which 5.3% (1/19) were positive for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. There were no antibodies detected to TPO. A total of 184 confirmed adult patients were included in this study; for these patients, the incidence of binding antibody post‑treatment was 3.8% (7/184) to romiplostim, of which 0.5% (1/184) was positive for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. A total of 2.2% (4/184) adult patients developed binding, non‑neutralising antibody against TPO.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.

                <p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics, other systemic haemostatics, ATC code: B02BX04</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Mechanism of action</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romiplostim is an Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) that signals and activates intracellular transcriptional pathways via the TPO receptor (also known as cMpl) to increase platelet production. The peptibody molecule is comprised of a human immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain, with each single‑chain subunit covalently linked at the C-terminus to a peptide chain containing 2 TPO receptor‑binding domains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romiplostim has no amino acid sequence homology to endogenous TPO. In preclinical and clinical trials no anti-romiplostim antibodies cross reacted with endogenous TPO.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Clinical efficacy and safety</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The safety and efficacy of romiplostim have been evaluated for up to 3&nbsp;years of continuous treatment. In clinical trials, treatment with romiplostim resulted in dose-dependent increases in platelet count. Time to reach the maximum effect on platelet count is approximately 10-14&nbsp;days, and is independent of the dose. After a single subcutaneous dose of 1 to 10&nbsp;mcg/kg romiplostim in ITP patients, the peak platelet count was 1.3 to 14.9 times greater than the baseline platelet count over a 2 to 3&nbsp;weeks period and the response was variable among patients. The platelet counts of ITP patients who received 6&nbsp;weekly doses of 1 or 3&nbsp;mcg/kg of romiplostim were within the range of 50&nbsp;to&nbsp;450&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>/L for most patients. Of the 271&nbsp;patients who received romiplostim in ITP clinical trials, 55 (20%) were age 65 and over, and 27 (10%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or efficacy have been observed between older and younger patients in the placebo-controlled studies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Results from pivotal placebo-controlled studies</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The safety and efficacy of romiplostim was evaluated in two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in adults with ITP who had completed at least one treatment prior to study entry and are representative of the entire spectrum of such ITP patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Study S1 (20030212) evaluated patients who were non-splenectomised and had an inadequate response or were intolerant to prior therapies. Patients had been diagnosed with ITP for a median of 2.1&nbsp;years (range&nbsp;0.1 to 31.6) at the time of study entry. Patients had received a median of 3 (range 1 to 7) treatments for ITP prior to study entry. Prior treatments included corticosteroids (90% of all patients), immunoglobulins (76%), rituximab (29%), cytotoxic therapies (21%), danazol (11%), and azathioprine (5%). Patients had a median platelet count of 19&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>/L at study entry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Study S2 (20030105) evaluated patients who were splenectomised and continued to have thrombocytopenia. Patients had been diagnosed with ITP for a median of 8&nbsp;years (range 0.6 to 44.8) at the time of study entry. In addition to a splenectomy, patients had received a median of 6 (range 3 to 10) treatments for ITP prior to study entry. Prior treatments included corticosteroids (98% of all patients), immunoglobulins (97%), rituximab (71%), danazol (37%), cytotoxic therapies (68%), and azathioprine (24%). Patients had a median platelet count of 14&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>/L at study entry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Both studies were similarly designed. Patients (&ge;&nbsp;18&nbsp;years) were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a starting dose of romiplostim 1&nbsp;mcg/kg or placebo. Patients received single subcutaneous weekly injections for 24&nbsp;weeks. Doses were adjusted to maintain (50 to 200&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>/L) platelet counts. In both studies, efficacy was determined by an increase in the proportion of patients who achieved a durable platelet response. The median average weekly dose for splenectomised patients was 3&nbsp;mcg/kg and for non‑splenectomised patients was 2&nbsp;mcg/kg.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving romiplostim achieved a durable platelet response compared to patients receiving placebo in both studies. Following the first 4-weeks of study romiplostim maintained platelet counts &ge;&nbsp;50&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>/L in between 50% to 70% of patients during the 6&nbsp;months treatment period in the placebo-controlled studies.

Rescue medications (i.e., corticosteroids, platelet transfusions, IVIG, azathioprine, anti-D immunoglobulin, and danazol) were permitted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Study S8 also evaluated bone marrows for reticulin and collagen formation as well as for abnormalities in paediatric patients with ITP receiving romiplostim treatment. The modified Bauermeister grading scale was used for reticulin and collagen assessments, whereas cytogenetics and fluorescence <em>in situ</em> hybridization (FISH) were used to evidence bone marrow abnormalities. Based on cohort assignment at the time of study enrolment, patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin and collagen at year&nbsp;1 (cohort 1) or year&nbsp;2 (cohort 2) in comparison to the baseline bone marrow at the start of the study. From the total of 79 patients enrolled in the 2 cohorts, 27 of 30 (90%) patients in cohort 1 and 36 of 49 (73.5%) patients in cohort 2 had evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsies. Increased reticulin fibre formation was reported for 18.5% (5 of 27) of patients in cohort 1 and 47.2% (17 of 36) of patients in cohort 2. No patients in either cohort developed collagen fibrosis or a bone marrow abnormality that was inconsistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP.</p>

                <p>The pharmacokinetics of romiplostim involved target‑mediated disposition, which is presumably mediated by TPO receptors on platelets and other cells of the thrombopoietic lineage such as megakaryocytes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Absorption</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After subcutaneous administration of 3 to 15&nbsp;mcg/kg romiplostim, maximum romiplostim serum levels in ITP patients were obtained after 7-50&nbsp;hours (median 14&nbsp;hours). The serum concentrations varied among patients and did not correlate with the dose administered. Romiplostim serum levels appear inversely related to platelet counts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Distribution</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The volume of distribution of romiplostim following intravenous administration of romiplostim decreased nonlinearly from 122, 78.8, to 48.2&nbsp;mL/kg for intravenous doses of 0.3, 1.0 and 10&nbsp;mcg/kg, respectively in healthy subjects. This non-linear decrease in volume of distribution is in line with the (megakaryocyte and platelet) target‑mediated binding of romiplostim, which may be saturated at the higher doses applied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Elimination</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elimination half-life of romiplostim in ITP patients ranged from 1 to 34&nbsp;days (median, 3.5&nbsp;days).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The elimination of serum romiplostim is in part dependent on the TPO receptor on platelets. As a result for a given dose, patients with high platelet counts are associated with low serum concentrations and <em>vice versa</em>. In another ITP clinical trial, no accumulation in serum concentrations was observed after 6&nbsp;weekly doses of romiplostim (3&nbsp;mcg/kg).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Special populations</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pharmacokinetics of romiplostim in patients with renal and hepatic impairment has not been investigated. Romiplostim pharmacokinetics appear not affected by age, weight and gender to a clinically significant extent.</p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p><u>Paediatric population</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pharmacokinetic data of romiplostim were collected from two studies in 21 paediatric subjects with ITP. In study S6 (20060195), romiplostim concentrations were available from 17 subjects at doses ranging from 1 to 10&nbsp;mcg/kg. In Study S7 (20090340), intensive romiplostim concentrations were available from 4 subjects (2 at 7&nbsp;mcg/kg and 2 at 9&nbsp;mcg/kg). Serum concentrations of romiplostim in paediatrics with ITP were within the range observed in adult ITP subjects receiving the same dose range of romiplostim. Similar to adults with ITP, romiplostim pharmacokinetics are highly variable in paediatric subjects with ITP and are not reliable and predictive. However, the data are insufficient to draw any meaningful conclusion relating to the impact of dose and age on the pharmacokinetics of romiplostim.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Multiple dose romiplostim toxicology studies were conducted in rats for 4&nbsp;weeks and in monkeys for up to 6&nbsp;months. In general, effects observed during these studies were related to the thrombopoietic activity of romiplostim and were similar regardless of study duration. Injection site reactions were also related to romiplostim administration. Myelofibrosis has been observed in the bone marrow of rats at all tested dose levels. In these studies, myelofibrosis was not observed in animals after a 4-week post‑treatment recovery period, indicating reversibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1&nbsp;month rat and monkey toxicology studies, a mild decrease in red blood cell count, haematocrit and haemoglobin was observed. There was also a stimulatory effect on leucocyte production, as peripheral blood counts for neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils were mildly increased. In the longer duration chronic monkey study, there was no effect on the erythroid and leucocytic lineages when romiplostim was administered for 6&nbsp;months where the administration of romiplostim was decreased from thrice weekly to once weekly. Additionally, in the phase 3 pivotal studies, romiplostim did not affect the red blood cell and white blood cells lineages relative to placebo treated subjects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the formation of neutralising antibodies pharmacodynamic effects of romiplostim in rats were often decreasing at prolonged duration of administration. Toxicokinetic studies showed no interaction of the antibodies with the measured concentrations. Although high doses were tested in the animal studies, due to differences between the laboratory species and humans with regard to the sensitivity for the pharmacodynamic effect of romiplostim and the effect of neutralising antibodies, safety margins cannot be reliably estimated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Carcinogenesis</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The carcinogenic potential of romiplostim has not been evaluated. Therefore, the risk of potential carcinogenicity of romiplostim in humans remains unknown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Reproductive toxicology</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In all developmental studies neutralising antibodies were formed, which may have inhibited romiplostim effects. In embryo-foetal development studies in mice and rats, reductions in maternal body weight were found only in mice. In mice there was evidence of increased post-implantation loss. In a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats an increase of the duration of gestation and a slight increase in the incidence of peri-natal pup mortality was found. Romiplostim is known to cross the placental barrier in rats and may be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus and stimulate foetal platelet production. Romiplostim had no observed effect on the fertility of rats.</p>
