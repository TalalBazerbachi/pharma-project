                <p>Idacio treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Idacio is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Idacio (see section 4.4).

Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Idacio and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Idacio may be re-administered.

                <p><u>Traceability</u></p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Infections</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Patients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function may increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for infections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Idacio. Because the elimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Treatment with Idacio should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or localised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis and patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Idacio should be considered prior to initiating therapy (see <em>Other opportunistic infections</em>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Idacio, should be monitored closely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Idacio should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of Idacio in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Serious infections</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Serious infections including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or other opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tuberculosis</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) tuberculosis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before initiation of therapy with Idacio, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive (&ldquo;latent&rdquo;) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of patient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the patient reminder card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Idacio therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully considered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be consulted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Idacio, and in accordance with local recommendations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Use of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Idacio in patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for tuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis infection (e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or after therapy with Idacio.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Other opportunistic infections</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving adalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF- antagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, dyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant shock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Idacio should be promptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive fungal infections.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Hepatitis B reactivation</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, who are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Idacio. For patients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Idacio should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, Idacio should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Neurological events</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Idacio in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Idacio should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Idacio therapy and regularly during treatment to assess for pre- existing or developing central demyelinating disorders.</p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p><u>Allergic reactions</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Serious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials.Reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab administration. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Idacio should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Immunosuppression</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in enumeration of effector T-, B -, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22&nbsp;years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy &le; 18 years of age), including adalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated with adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in young adult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6‑mercaptopurine used for inflammatory bowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6‑mercaptopurine and adalimumab should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Idacio cannot be excluded (see section 4.8).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom treatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional caution should be exercised in considering Idacio treatment of these patients (see section 4.8).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-melanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Idacio. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see section 4.8).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Haematologic reactions</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. thrombocytopenia, leucopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Idacio. Discontinuation of Idacio therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Vaccinations</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Similar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent virus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were treated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating adalimumab therapy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Patients on adalimumab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration of live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 12 months following the mother&rsquo;s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Congestive heart failure</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Idacio should be used with caution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Idacio is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section 4.3). Treatment with Idacio must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Autoimmune processes</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Treatment with Idacio may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Idacio and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Idacio should not be given (see section 4.8).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Serious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF‑antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the combination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Concomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDs (e.g, anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section 4.5).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Surgery</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The long half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who requires surgery while on Idacio should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving adalimumab.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Small bowel obstruction</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Failure to respond to treatment for Crohn&rsquo;s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture that may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause strictures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Elderly</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The frequency of serious infections among adalimumab treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) was higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Paediatric population</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See Vaccinations above.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Excipients with known effects</u></p><p>This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 &nbsp;ml dose, i.e. essentially &#39;sodium-free&#39;.</p>

The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. The rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 (8.7%) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA (unadjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with CD and 3/32 (9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The adjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD combined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the secondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious or opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-randomized design.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available (see section 5.3).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Due to its inhibition of TNF&alpha;, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune responses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Adalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab during pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection.

                <p><u>Summary of the safety profile</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Adalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn&rsquo;s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients receiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, controlled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4% for control treated patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Serious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab affect the immune system and their use may affect the body&rsquo;s defence against infection and cancer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV reactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use of adalimumab.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Paediatric population</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Tabulated list of adverse reactions</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing experience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 7 below:</p><p>very common (&ge; 1/10); common (&ge; 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (&ge; 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (&ge; 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Infections</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in the adalimumab treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab treated patients and 0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control&minus;treated patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections (including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years during adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis).

Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab usually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Crohn&#39;s disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with adalimumab. In patients with Crohn&rsquo;s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in the colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNF&alpha; was seen. Endoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Clinical efficacy and safety</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Rheumatoid arthritis</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Adalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were &ge;&nbsp;18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had insufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25&nbsp;mg (10&nbsp;mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25&nbsp;mg every week. Doses of 20, 40 or 80&nbsp;mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were &ge;&nbsp;18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs.</p><p>Doses of 20 or 40&nbsp;mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were &ge;&nbsp;18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25&nbsp;mg or have been intolerant to 10&nbsp;mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first received placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20&nbsp;mg of adalimumab every week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40&nbsp;mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open- label extension phase in which 40&nbsp;mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other week up to 10 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were &ge;&nbsp;18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug-na&iuml;ve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40&nbsp;mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-na&iuml;ve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early rheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of adalimumab 40&nbsp;mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40&nbsp;mg every other week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 weeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40&nbsp;mg of adalimumab was administered every other week up to 10 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the percentage of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA study V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III and V had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><u>ACR response</u></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across RA studies I, II and III.

The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, concentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to 15&nbsp; ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Following subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5&nbsp;&micro;g/ml (without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 &micro;g/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.
