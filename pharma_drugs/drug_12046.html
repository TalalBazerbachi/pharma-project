                <p>Treatment should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of atopic dermatitis.<br />Posology<br />The recommended dose of tralokinumab for adult patients is an initial dose of 600 mg (four 150 mg injections) followed by 300 mg (two 150 mg injections) administered every other week as subcutaneous injection.<br />At prescriber&rsquo;s discretion, every fourth week dosing may be considered for patients who achieve clear or almost clear skin after 16 weeks of treatment. The probability of maintaining clear or almost clear skin may be lower with every fourth week dosing (see section 5.1).<br />Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve further with continued treatment every other week beyond 16 weeks.<br />Tralokinumab can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. The use of topical corticosteroids, when appropriate, may provide an additional effect to the overall efficacy of tralokinumab (see&nbsp;section 5.1)<br />. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used, but should be reserved for problem areas only, such as the face, neck, intertriginous and genital areas.<br />Missed dose<br />If a dose is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, dosing should be resumed at the regular scheduled time.<br />Special populations<br />Elderly (&ge; 65 years)<br />No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Limited data is available in patients &gt; 75 years of age.<br />Renal impairment<br />No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. Very limited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2).<br />Hepatic impairment<br />No dose adjustment is needed in patients with hepatic impairment. Very limited data are available in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).<br />High body weight<br />For patients with high body weight (&gt;100 kg), who achieve clear or almost clear skin after 16 weeks of treatment, reducing the dosage to every fourth week might not be appropriate (see section 5.2).<br />Paediatric population<br />The safety and efficacy of tralokinumab in children below the age of 18 years have not yet been established. No data are available.<br />Method of administration<br />Subcutaneous use.<br />The pre-filled syringe should be not shaken. After removing the pre-filled syringes from the refrigerator, they should be allowed to reach room temperature by waiting for 30 minutes before injecting.<br />Tralokinumab is administered by subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, except the 5 cm around the navel. If somebody else administers the injection, the upper arm can also be used.<br />For the initial 600 mg dose, four 150 mg tralokinumab injections should be administered consecutively in different injection sites.<br />It is recommended to rotate the injection site with each dose. Tralokinumab should not be injected into skin that is tender, damaged or has bruises or scars.<br />A patient may self-inject tralokinumab or the patient&#39;s caregiver may administer tralokinumab if their healthcare professional determines that this is appropriate. Proper training should be provided to patients and/or caregivers on the administration of tralokinumab prior to use. Detailed instructions for use are included at the end of the package leaflet.</p>

It is unknown if tralokinumab will influence the immune response against helminth infections by inhibiting IL-13 signalling.<br />Patients with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before initiating treatment with tralokinumab. If patients become infected while receiving tralokinumab and do not respond to antihelminth treatment, treatment with tralokinumab should be discontinued until infection resolves.<br />Vaccinations<br />Live and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with tralokinumab as clinical safety and efficacy have not been established. Immune responses to the non-live tetanus and meningococcal vaccines were assessed (see section 4.5). It is recommended that patients should be brought up to date with live and live attenuated immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to treatment with tralokinumab.<br />Sodium content<br />This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 150 mg dose, that is to say essentially &ldquo;sodium-free&rdquo;.</p>

A total of 807 patients were treated with tralokinumab for at least 1 year.<br />Listed in Table 1 are adverse reactions observed from clinical trials presented by system organ class and frequency, using the following categories: very common (&ge; 1/10); common (&ge; 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (&ge; 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (&ge; 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The frequencies are based on the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies in the atopic dermatitis population.</p><p>Table 1: List of adverse reactions<br />MedDRA System Organ Class<br />Frequency<br />Adverse reaction<br />Infections and infestations<br />Very common Common<br />Upper respiratory tract infections<br />Conjunctivitis<br />Blood and lymphatic system disorders<br />Common<br />Eosinophilia<br />Eye disorders<br />Common<br />Uncommon<br />Conjunctivitis allergic<br />Keratitis<br />General disorders and administration site conditions<br />Common<br />Injection site reactions<br />The long-term safety of tralokinumab was assessed in the 2 monotherapy studies up to 52 weeks and in 1 combination study with topical corticosteroids up to 32 weeks. The safety profile of tralokinumab through week 52 and week 32 respectively was consistent with the safety profile observed up to week 16.</p><p>of selected adverse reactions<br />Conjunctivitis and related events<br />Conjunctivitis occurred more frequently in atopic dermatitis patients who received tralokinumab (5.4%) compared to placebo (1.9%) in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies. Conjunctivitis was reported at a higher frequency in patients with severe atopic dermatitis compared to subjects with moderate atopic dermatitis in both the tralokinumab group (6.0 vs 3.3%; initial treatment period) and placebo group (2.2 vs 0.8%; initial treatment period). Most patients recovered or were recovering during the treatment period.<br />Keratitis was reported in 0.5% of subjects treated with tralokinumab during the initial treatment period. Of these, half were classified as keratoconjunctivitis, all were non-serious and mild or moderate in severity, and none led to treatment discontinuation.<br />Eosinophilia<br />Adverse reactions of eosinophilia were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with tralokinumab and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo during the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies. Tralokinumab-treated patients had a greater mean initial increase from baseline in eosinophil count compared to patients treated with placebo. Eosinophilia (&ge; 5 000 cells/mcL) was measured in 1.2% of tralokinumab-treated patients and 0.3% of placebo-treated patients in the initial treatment period. However, the increase in the tralokinumab-treated patients was transient, and mean eosinophil counts returned to baseline during continued treatment. The safety profile for subjects with eosinophilia was comparable to the safety profile for all subjects.<br />Eczema Herpeticum<br />Eczema herpeticum was reported in 0.3% of the subjects treated with tralokinumab and in 1.5% of subjects in the placebo group, in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies in atopic dermatitis. Across all treatment periods in the pool of 5 studies, all eczema herpeticum events reported in the tralokinumab group were non-serious, none were severe, and a single event in one subject led to permanent discontinuation of treatment.<br />Immunogenicity<br />As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with tralokinumab.<br />Anti-drug-antibody (ADA) responses were not associated with any impact on tralokinumab exposure, safety, or efficacy.<br />In ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2, ECZTRA 3, and the vaccine-response study, the incidence of ADA up to 16 weeks was 1.4% for patients treated with tralokinumab and 1.3% for patients treated with placebo;</p><p>neutralising antibodies were seen in 0.1% of patients treated with tralokinumab and 0.2% of patients treated with placebo.<br />Across all trial periods, the ADA incidence for subjects who received tralokinumab was 4.6%; 0.9% had persistent ADA and 1.0% had neutralising antibodies.<br />Injection site reactions<br />Injection site reactions (including pain and redness) occurred more frequently in patients who received tralokinumab (7.2%) compared to placebo (3.0%) in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies. Across all treatment periods in the 5 studies in atopic dermatitis, the vast majority (99%) of injection site reactions were mild or moderate in severity, and few patients (&lt; 1%) discontinued tralokinumab treatment. Most injections site reactions reported had a short duration with approximately 76% of the events resolving within 1 to 5 days.<br />Reporting of suspected adverse reactions<br />Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.

                <p>5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties<br />Pharmacotherapeutic group: Agents for dermatitis, excluding corticosteroids, ATC code: D11AH07.<br />Mechanism of action<br />Tralokinumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the type 2 cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13) and inhibits its interaction with the IL-13 receptors. Tralokinumab neutralises the biological activity of IL-13 by blocking its interaction with the IL-13R&alpha;1/IL-4R&alpha;&nbsp;receptor complex. IL-13 is a major driver of human type 2 inflammatory disease, such as atopic dermatitis and inhibiting the IL-13 pathway with tralokinumab in patients decreases many of the mediators of type 2 inflammation.<br />Pharmacodynamic effects<br />In clinical trials, treatment with tralokinumab resulted in reduced levels of type 2 inflammation biomarkers in both lesional skin (CCL17, CCL18 and CCL26) and in blood (CCL17, periostin and IgE). In lesional skin, treatment with tralokinumab led also to reductions in epidermal thickness and to increase in marker of epithelial barrier integrity (loricrin). Skin colonization with Staphylococcus aureus was reduced more than 10-fold in patients treated with tralokinumab.&nbsp;</p><p>Clinical efficacy and safety<br />The efficacy and safety of tralokinumab as monotherapy and with concomitant topical corticosteroids were evaluated in three pivotal randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2 and ECZTRA 3) in 1 976 patients 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis defined by Investigator&rsquo;s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 or 4 (moderate or severe), an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score of &ge; 16 at baseline, and a minimum body surface area (BSA) involvement of &ge; 10%. Eligible patients enrolled into the three studies had previous inadequate response to topical medication.<br />In all three studies, patients received 1) an initial dose of 600 mg tralokinumab (four 150 mg injections) on day 1, followed by 300 mg every two weeks (Q2W) up to week 16 or 2) matching placebo. In ECZTRA 3, patients received concomitant topical corticosteroids on active lesions as needed. Tralokinumab was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in all studies.</p><p>In ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2, to evaluate the maintenance of response, patients responding to the initial 16-week treatment with tralokinumab (i.e. achieved IGA 0 or 1, or EASI-75) were re-randomised to 1) tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W or 2) tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W (alternating tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo Q2W) or 3) placebo Q2W up to 52 weeks. The main endpoints for evaluating maintenance of response were IGA 0 or 1 and EASI-75 at week 52. Patients responding to the initial 16-week treatment with placebo continued on placebo. Subjects not achieving IGA 0 or 1 or EASI-75 at week 16 and subjects who did not maintain the response during the maintenance period were transferred to open-label treatment with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W with optional use of topical corticosteroids.

                <p>Absorption<br />After subcutaneous (SC) dose of tralokinumab median time to maximum concentration in serum (tmax) were 5-8 days. The absolute bioavailability of tralokinumab following SC dosing was estimated by population PK analysis to be 76%. In a phase 1 trial (10 subjects per arm), bioavailability was estimated to be 62% for the 150 mg dose and 60% for the 300 mg dose.<br />Steady-state concentrations were achieved by week 16 following a 600 mg starting dose and 300 mg every other week. Across clinical studies (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2 and ECZTRA 3), the mean &plusmn;SD steady-state trough concentration ranged from 98.0&plusmn;41.1 mcg/mL to 101.4&plusmn;42.7 mcg/mL for 300 mg dose administered every other week.<br />Distribution<br />A volume of distribution for tralokinumab of approximately 4.2 L was estimated by population PK analysis.<br />Biotransformation<br />Specific metabolism studies were not conducted because tralokinumab is a protein. Tralokinumab is expected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids.<br />Elimination<br />Tralokinumab is eliminated through a non-saturable proteolytic pathway. Half-life is 22 days, consistent with the typical estimate for human IgG4 monoclonal antibodies targeting soluble cytokines. In ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2, and ECZTRA 3, clearance was estimated by population PK analysis to be 0.149 L/day. In phase 1 trials with IV dosing, clearance was estimated to be between 0.179 and 0.211 L/day<br />Linearity/non-linearity<br />Exposure of tralokinumab increases proportionally to the dose of tralokinumab between 150-600 mg.<br />Drug interactions<br />The effects of tralokinumab on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CYP substrates were evaluated in AD patients after repeated administration. The results did not indicate clinically relevant effects of tralokinumab on caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole&nbsp;(CYP2C19 substrate), metoprolol (CYP2D6 substrate) and midazolam (CYP3A substrate). Therefore, tralokinumab is not expected to impact the pharmacokinetics of concomitant medicines metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (see section 4.5).<br />Special populations<br />Gender<br />Gender was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure of tralokinumab determined by population PK analysis.<br />Age<br />Age was not found to be associated with clinically relevant impact of systemic exposure of tralokinumab determined by population PK analysis. 109 subjects above 65 years were included in the analysis.<br />Race<br />Race was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure of tralokinumab by population PK analysis.<br />Hepatic impairment<br />Tralokinumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination. No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tralokinumab. Mild hepatic impairment was not found to affect the PK of tralokinumab determined by population PK analysis. Very limited data are available in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.<br />Renal impairment<br />Tralokinumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant renal elimination. No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tralokinumab. Population PK analysis did not identify mild or moderate renal impairment as having a clinically meaningful influence on the systemic exposure of tralokinumab.
