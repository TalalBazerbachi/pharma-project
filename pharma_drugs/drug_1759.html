                <p><strong>Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis </strong></p><p>Simvastatin, like other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and very rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma.</p><p>As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is dose related. In a clinical trial database in which 41,413 patients were treated with Viscor, 24,747 (approximately 60 %) of whom were enrolled in studies with a median follow-up of at least 4 years, the incidence of myopathy was approximately 0.03 %, 0.08 % and 0.61 % at 20, 40 and 80 mg/day, respectively. In these trials, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded.</p><p>In a clinical trial in which patients with a history of myocardial infarction were treated with Viscor 80 mg/day (mean follow-up 6.7 years), the incidence of myopathy was approximately 1.0 % compared with 0.02 % for patients on 20 mg/day. Approximately half of these myopathy cases occurred during the first year of treatment. The incidence of myopathy during each subsequent year of treatment was approximately 0.1 %. (See sections 4.8 and 5.1.)</p><p>The risk of myopathy is greater in patients on simvastatin 80 mg compared with other statin-based therapies with similar LDL-C-lowering efficacy. Therefore, the 80-mg dose of Viscor should only be used in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia and at high risk for cardiovascular complications who have not achieved their treatment goals on lower doses and when the benefits are expected to<br />outweigh the potential risks. In patients taking simvastatin 80 mg for whom an interacting agent is needed, a lower dose of simvastatin or an alternative statin-based regimen with less potential for drug-drug interactions should be used (see below Measures to reduce the risk of myopathy caused by medicinal product interactions and sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.5).<br /><u>Creatine Kinase measurement</u><br />Creatine Kinase (CK) should not be measured following strenuous exercise or in the presence of any plausible alternative cause of CK increase as this makes value interpretation difficult. If CK levels are significantly elevated at baseline (&gt; 5 x ULN), levels should be re-measured within 5 to 7 days later to confirm the results.<br /><u>Before the treatment</u><br />All patients starting therapy with simvastatin, or whose dose of simvastatin is being increased, should be advised of the risk of myopathy and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness.<br />Caution should be exercised in patients with pre-disposing factors for rhabdomyolysis. In order to establish a reference baseline value, a CK level should be measured before starting a treatment in the following situations:<br />&bull; Elderly (age &ge; 65 years)<br />&bull; Female gender<br />&bull; Renal impairment<br />&bull; Uncontrolled hypothyroidism<br />&bull; Personal or familial history of hereditary muscular disorders<br />&bull; Previous history of muscular toxicity with a statin or fibrate<br />&bull; Alcohol abuse.<br />In such situations, the risk of treatment should be considered in relation to possible benefit, and clinical monitoring is recommended. If a patient has previously experienced a muscle disorder on a fibrate or a statin, treatment with a different member of the class should only be initiated with caution. If CK levels are significantly elevated at baseline (&gt; 5 x ULN), treatment should not be started.</p><p><u>Whilst on treatment</u><br />If muscle pain, weakness or cramps occur whilst a patient is receiving treatment with a statin, their CK levels should be measured. If these levels are found, in the absence of strenuous exercise, to be significantly elevated (&gt; 5 x ULN), treatment should be stopped. If muscular symptoms are severe and cause daily discomfort, even if CK levels are &lt; 5 x ULN, treatment discontinuation may be considered. If myopathy is suspected for any other reason, treatment should be discontinued.<br />If symptoms resolve and CK levels return to normal, then re-introduction of the statin or introduction of an alternative statin may be considered at the lowest dose and with close monitoring.<br />A higher rate of myopathy has been observed in patients titrated to the 80 mg dose (see section 5.1).<br />Periodic CK measurements are recommended as they may be useful to identify subclinical cases of myopathy. However, there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent myopathy.<br />Therapy with simvastatin should be temporarily stopped a few days prior to elective major surgery and when any major medical or surgical condition supervenes.</p><p><u><em>Measures to reduce the risk of myopathy caused by medicinal product interactions (see also section 4.5)</em></u></p><p>The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is significantly increased by concomitant use of simvastatin with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. nelfinavir), boceprevir, telaprevir, nefazodone), as well as gemfibrozil, ciclosporin, and danazol. Use of these medicinal products is contraindicated (see section 4.3).<br />The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is also increased by concomitant use of amiodarone, amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem with certain doses of simvastatin (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, may be increased by concomitant administration of fusidic acid with statins (see section 4.5).<br />Consequently, regarding CYP3A4 inhibitors, the use of simvastatin concomitantly with itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. nelfinavir), boceprevir, telaprevir, erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin and nefazodone is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). If treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (agents that increase AUC approximately 5 fold or greater) is unavoidable, therapy with simvastatin must be suspended (and use of an alternative statin considered) during the course of treatment.</p><p>Moreover, caution should be exercised when combining simvastatin with certain other less potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: fluconazole, verapamil, diltiazem (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). Concomitant intake of grapefruit juice and simvastatin should be avoided.<br />The use of simvastatin with gemfibrozil is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Due to the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, the dose of simvastatin should not exceed 10 mg daily in patients taking simvastatin with other fibrates, except fenofibrate. (See sections 4.2 and 4.5.) Caution should be used when prescribing fenofibrate with simvastatin, as either agent can cause myopathy when given alone.<br />Simvastatin must not be co-administered with fusidic acid. There have been reports of rhabdomyolysis (including some fatalities) in patients receiving this combination (see section 4.5).<br />In patients where the use of systemic fusidic acid is considered essential, statin treatment should be discontinued throughout the duration of fusidic acid treatment. The patient should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if they experience any symptoms of muscle weakness, pain or tenderness. Statin therapy may be re-introduced seven days after the last dose of fusidic acid. In exceptional circumstances, where prolonged systemic fusidic acid is needed, e.g., for the treatment of severe infections, the need for co-administration of simvastatin and fusidic acid should only be considered on a case by case basis and under close medical supervision.<br />The combined use of simvastatin at doses higher than 20 mg daily with amiodarone, amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem should be avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).<br />Patients taking other medicines labelled as having a moderate inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 concomitantly with simvastatin, particularly higher simvastatin doses, may have an increased risk of myopathy. When coadministering simvastatin with a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 (agents that increase AUC approximately 2-5 fold), a dose adjustment of simvastatin may be necessary. For<br />certain moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors e.g. diltiazem, a maximum dose of 20mg simvastatin is recommended (see section 4.2)</p><p>Rare cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and lipid-modifying doses (&ge; 1 g/day) of niacin (nicotinic acid), either of which can cause myopathy when given alone.<br />Physicians contemplating combined therapy with simvastatin and lipid-modifying doses (&ge; 1 g/day) of niacin (nicotinic acid) or products containing niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and when the dose of either medicinal product is increased.</p><p>In an interim analysis of an ongoing clinical outcomes study, an independent safety monitoring committee identified a higher than expected incidence of myopathy in Chinese patients taking simvastatin 40 mg and nicotinic acid/laropiprant 2000 mg/40 mg. Therefore, caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with simvastatin (particularly doses of 40 mg or higher) coadministered with lipid-modifying doses (&ge; 1 g/day) of niacin (nicotinic acid) or products containing niacin. Because the risk of myopathy with statins is dose-related, the use of simvastatin 80 mg with lipid-modifying doses (&ge; 1 g/day) of niacin (nicotinic acid) or products containing niacin is not recommended in Chinese patients. It is unknown whether there is an increased risk of myopathy in other Asian patients treated with simvastatin co-administered with lipid-modifying doses (&ge; 1 g/day) of niacin (nicotinic acid) or products containing niacin</p><p><u>Hepatic effects</u><br />In clinical studies, persistent increases (to &gt; 3 x ULN) in serum transaminases have occurred in a few adult patients who received simvastatin. When simvastatin was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pre-treatment levels.</p><p>It is recommended that liver function tests be performed before treatment begins and thereafter when clinically indicated. Patients titrated to the 80-mg dose should receive an additional test prior to titration, 3 months after titration to the 80-mg dose, and periodically thereafter (e.g., semi-annually) for the first year of treatment. Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to 3 x ULN and are persistent, simvastatin should be discontinued. Note that ALT may emanate from muscle, therefore ALT rising with CK may indicate myopathy (see above <em>Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis</em>).<br />There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including simvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinaemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with Viscor, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart Viscor.<br />The product should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. As with other lipid-lowering agents, moderate (&lt; 3 x ULN) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with simvastatin. These changes appeared soon after initiation of therapy with simvastatin, were often transient, were not accompanied by any symptoms and interruption of treatment was not required.</p><p><u>Diabetes mellitus </u></p><p>Some evidence suggests that statins as a class raise blood glucose and in some patients, at high risk of future diabetes, may produce a level of hyperglycaemia where formal diabetes care is appropriate. This risk, however, is outweighed by the reduction in vascular risk with statins and therefore should not be a reason for stopping statin treatment. Patients at risk (fasting glucose 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L, BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2, raised triglycerides, hypertension) should be monitored both clinically and biochemically according to national guidelines</p><p><u>Interstitial lung disease </u></p><p>Cases of interstitial lung disease have been reported with some statins, including simvastatin, especially with long term therapy (see section 4.8). Presenting features can include dyspnoea, nonproductive cough and deterioration in general health (fatigue, weight loss and fever). If it is suspected a patient has developed interstitial lung disease, statin therapy should be discontinued.</p><p><u>Use in children and adolescents (10-17 years of age) </u></p><p>Safety and effectiveness of simvastatin in patients 10-17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial in adolescent boys Tanner Stage II and above and in girls who were at least one year post-menarche. Patients treated with simvastatin had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. <strong>Doses greater than 40 mg have not been studied in this population</strong>. In this limited controlled study, there was no detectable effect on growth or sexual maturation in the adolescent boys or girls, or any effect on menstrual cycle length in girls. (See sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1.). Adolescent females should be counselled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on simvastatin therapy (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). In patients aged &lt; 18 years, efficacy and safety have not been studied for treatment periods &gt; 48 weeks&#39; duration and long-term effects on physical, intellectual, and sexual maturation are unknown. Simvastatin has not been studied in patients younger than 10 years of age, nor in pre-pubertal children and pre-menarchal girls.</p><p><u>Excipient </u></p><p>This product contains lactose.

                <p>Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.</p><p><em><u>Pharmacodynamic interactions </u></em></p><p>Interactions with lipid-lowering medicinal products that can cause myopathy when given alone The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, is increased during concomitant administration with fibrates. Additionally, there is a pharmacokinetic interaction with gemfibrozil resulting in increased simvastatin plasma levels (see belowPharmacokinetic interactions and sections 4.3 and 4.4). When simvastatin and fenofibrate are given concomitantly, there is no evidence that the risk of myopathy exceeds the sum of the individual risks of each agent. Adequate pharmacovigilance and pharmacokinetic data are not available for other fibrates. Rare cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been associated with simvastatin co-administered with lipid-modifying doses (&ge; 1 g/day) of niacin (see section 4.4).</p><p><u><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions</em></u><br />Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in the table below (further details are provided in the text; see also sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4).</p><table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" style="width:560px"><tbody><tr><td style="width:285px">Interacting agents</td><td style="width:272px">Prescribing recommendations</td></tr><tr><td style="width:285px">Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, e.g.:<br />Itraconazole<br />Ketoconazole<br />Posaconazole<br />Voriconazole<br />Erythromycin<br />Clarithromycin<br />Telithromycin<br />HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. nelfinavir)<br />Boceprivir<br />Telparevir<br />Nefazodone<br />Ciclosporin<br />Danazol<br />Gemfibrozil</td><td style="width:272px">Contraindicated with simvastatin</td></tr><tr><td style="width:285px">Other fibrates (except fenofibrate)</td><td style="width:272px">Do not exceed 10 mg simvastatin daily</td></tr><tr><td style="width:285px">Fusidic acid</td><td style="width:272px">Is not recommended with simvastatin</td></tr><tr><td style="width:285px">Amiodarone<br />Amlodipine<br />Verapamil<br />Diltiazem</td><td style="width:272px">Do not exceed 20 mg simvastatin daily</td></tr><tr><td style="width:285px">Grapefruit juice</td><td style="width:272px">Avoid grapefruit juice when taking simvastatin</td></tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Effects of other medicinal products on simvastatin </em></p><p><em>Interactions involving inhibitors of CYP3A4 </em></p><p>Simvastatin is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4. Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis by increasing the concentration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma during simvastatin therapy. Such inhibitors include itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. nelfinavir), boceprevir, telaprevir and nefazodone. Concomitant administration of itraconazole resulted in a more than 10-fold increase in exposure to simvastatin acid (the active beta-hydroxyacid metabolite). Telithromycin caused an 11-fold increase in exposure to simvastatin acid.</p><p>Combination with itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. nelfinavir), boceprevir, telaprevir erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin and nefazodone is contraindicated, as well as gemfibrozil, ciclosporin, and danazol (see section 4.3). If treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (agents that increase AUC approximately 5 fold or greater) is unavoidable, therapy with simvastatin must be suspended (and use of an alternative stain considered) during the course of treatment. Caution should be exercised when combining simvastatin with certain other less potent CYP3A4 inhibitors: fluconazole, verapamil, or diltiazem (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</p><p><em>Fluconazole </em></p><p>Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis associated with concomitant administration of simvastatin and fluconazole have been reported (see section 4.4).</p><p><em>Ciclosporin </em></p><p>The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of ciclosporin with simvastatin; therefore, use with ciclosporin is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Although the mechanism is not fully understood, ciclosporin has been shown to increase the AUC of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The increase in AUC for simvastatin acid is presumably due, in part, to inhibition of CYP3A4.</p><p><em>Danazol</em><br />The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of danazol with simvastatin; therefore, use with danazol is contraindicated. (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).<br /><em>Gemfibrozil</em><br />Gemfibrozil increases the AUC of simvastatin acid by 1.9-fold, possibly due to inhibition of the glucuronidation pathway (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Concomitant administration with gemfibrozil is contraindicated.</p><p><em>Fusidic acid </em></p><p>The risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis may be increased by the concomitant administration of systemic fusidic acid with statins. Co-administration of this combination may cause increased plasma concentrations of both agents. The mechanism of this interaction (whether it is pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetic, or both) is yet unknown. There have been reports of rhabdomyolysis (including some fatalities) in patients receiving this combination. If treatment with fusidic acid is necessary, simvastatin treatment should be discontinued throughout the duration of the fusidic acid treatment. (See section 4.4.)</p><p><em>Amiodarone</em></p><p>The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of amiodarone with simvastatin (see section 4.4). In a clinical trial, myopathy was reported in 6 % of patients receiving simvastatin 80 mg and amiodarone. Therefore, the dose of simvastatin should not exceed 20 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with amiodarone.</p><p><em>Calcium Channel Blockers<br />&bull; Verapamil</em><br />The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of verapamil with simvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg (see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant administration with verapamil resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in exposure of simvastatin acid, presumably due, in part, to inhibition of CYP3A4. Therefore, the dose of simvastatin should not exceed 20 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with verapamil.</p><p><em>&bull; Diltiazem </em></p><p>The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of diltiazem with simvastatin 80 mg (see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant administration of diltiazem caused a 2.7-fold increase in exposure of simvastatin acid, presumably due to inhibition of CYP3A4. Therefore, the dose of simvastatin should not exceed 20 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with diltiazem.</p><p>&bull; <em>Amlodipine </em></p><p>Patients on amlodipine treated concomitantly with simvastatin have an increased risk of myopathy. In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant administration of amlodipine caused a 1.6-fold increase in exposure of simvastatin acid. Therefore, the dose of simvastatin should not exceed 20 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with amlodipine</p><p><em>Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4</em></p><p>Patients taking other medicines labelled as having a moderate inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 concomitantly with simvastatin, particularly higher simvastatin doses, may have an increased risk of myopathy (see section 4.4).</p><p><em>Niacin (nicotinic acid) </em></p><p>Rare cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been associated with simvastatin co-administered with lipid-modifying doses (&ge; 1 g/day) of niacin (nicotinic acid). In a pharmacokinetic study, the coadministration of a single dose of nicotinic acid prolonged-release 2 g with simvastatin 20 mg resulted in a modest increase in the AUC of simvastatin and simvastatin acid and in the Cmax of simvastatin acid plasma concentrations.</p><p><em>Grapefruit juice</em></p><p>Grapefruit juice inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant intake of large quantities (over 1 litre daily) of grapefruit juice and simvastatin resulted in a 7-fold increase in exposure to simvastatin acid. Intake of 240 ml of grapefruit juice in the morning and simvastatin in the evening also resulted in a 1.9-fold increase. Intake of grapefruit juice during treatment with simvastatin should therefore be avoided</p><p><em>Colchicine </em></p><p>There have been reports of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with the concomitant administration of colchicine and simvastatin in patients with renal insufficiency. Close clinical monitoring of such patients taking this combination is advised.</p><p><em>Rifampicin </em></p><p>Because rifampicin is a potent CYP3A4 inducer, patients undertaking long-term rifampicin therapy (e.g. treatment of tuberculosis) may experience loss of efficacy of simvastatin. In a pharmacokinetic study in normal volunteers, the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) for simvastatin acid was decreased by 93% with concomitant administration of rifampicin.</p><p><em>Effects of simvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products</em></p><p>Simvastatin does not have an inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 3A4. Therefore, simvastatin is not expected to affect plasma concentrations of substances metabolised via cytochrome P450 3A4. Oral anticoagulants</p><p>In two clinical studies, one in normal volunteers and the other in hypercholesterolaemic patients, simvastatin 20-40 mg/day modestly potentiated the effect of coumarin anticoagulants: the prothrombin time, reported as International Normalized Ratio (INR), increased from a baseline of 1.7 to 1.8 and from 2.6 to 3.4 in the volunteer and patient studies, respectively. Very rare cases of elevated INR have been reported. In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants, prothrombin time should be determined before starting simvastatin and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occurs. Once a stable prothrombin time has been documented, prothrombin times can be monitored at the intervals usually recommended for patients on coumarin anticoagulants. If the dose of simvastatin is changed or discontinued, the same procedure should be repeated. Simvastatin therapy has not been associated with bleeding or with changes in prothrombin time in patients not taking anticoagulants</p>

                <p><em>Pregnancy</em></p><p>Viscor is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).</p><p>Safety in pregnant women has not been established. No controlled clinical trials with simvastatin have been conducted in pregnant women. Rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been received. However, in an analysis of approximately 200 prospectively followed pregnancies exposed during the first trimester to Viscor or another closely related HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, the incidence of congenital anomalies was comparable to that seen in the general population. This number of pregnancies was statistically sufficient to exclude a 2.5-fold or greater increase in congenital anomalies over the background incidence.</p><p>Although there is no evidence that the incidence of congenital anomalies in offspring of patients taking Viscor or another closely related HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor differs from that observed in the general population, maternal treatment with Viscor may reduce the foetal levels of mevalonate which is a precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and ordinarily discontinuation of lipid-lowering medicinal products during pregnancy should have little impact on the long-term risk associated with primary hypercholesterolaemia. For these reasons, Viscor must not be used in women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant. Treatment with Viscor must be suspended for the duration of pregnancy or until it has been determined that the woman is not pregnant. (See sections 4.3 and 5.3.)</p><p><em>Lactation</em><br />It is not known whether simvastatin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many medicinal products are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, women taking Viscor must not breast-feed their infants (see section 4.3).</p>

                <p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor</p><p>ATC-Code: C10A A01</p><p>After oral ingestion, simvastatin, which is an inactive lactone, is hydrolyzed in the liver to the corresponding active beta-hydroxyacid form which has a potent activity in inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (3 hydroxy &ndash; 3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase). This enzyme catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol.</p><p>Viscor has been shown to reduce both normal and elevated LDL-C concentrations. LDL is formed from very-low-density protein (VLDL) and is catabolised predominantly by the high affinity LDL receptor. The mechanism of the LDL-lowering effect of Viscor may involve both reduction of VLDL-cholesterol (VLDL-C) concentration and induction of the LDL receptor, leading to reduced production and increased catabolism of LDL-C. Apolipoprotein B also falls substantially during treatment with Viscor. In addition, Viscor moderately increases HDL-C and reduces plasma TG. As a result of these changes the ratios of total- to HDL-C and LDL- to HDL-C are reduced.</p><p><u>High Risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) or Existing Coronary Heart Disease </u></p><p>In the Heart Protection Study (HPS), the effects of therapy with Viscor were assessed in 20,536 patients (age 40-80 years), with or without hyperlipidaemia, and with coronary heart disease, other occlusive arterial disease or diabetes mellitus. In this study, 10,269 patients were treated with Viscor 40 mg/day and 10,267 patients were treated with placebo for a mean duration of 5 years. At baseline, 6,793 patients (33 %) had LDL-C levels below 116 mg/dL; 5,063 patients (25 %) had levels between 116 mg/dL and 135 mg/dL; and 8,680 patients (42 %) had levels greater than 135 mg/dL.</p><p>Treatment with Viscor 40 mg/day compared with placebo significantly reduced the risk of all cause mortality (1328 [12.9 %] for simvastatin-treated patients versus 1507 [14.7 %] for patients given placebo; p = 0.0003), due to an 18 % reduction in coronary death rate (587 [5.7 %] versus 707 [6.9 %]; p = 0.0005; absolute risk reduction of 1.2 %). The reduction in non-vascular deaths did not reach statistical significance. Viscor also decreased the risk of major coronary events (a composite endpoint comprised of non-fatal MI or CHD death) by 27 % (p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>reduced the need for undergoing coronary revascularization procedures (including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) and peripheral and other noncoronary revascularization procedures by 30 % (p &lt; 0.0001) and 16 % (p = 0.006), respectively. Viscor reduced the risk of stroke by 25 % (p &lt; 0.0001), attributable to a 30 % reduction in ischemic stroke (p &lt; 0.0001). In addition, within the subgroup of patients with diabetes, Viscor reduced the risk of developing macrovascular complications, including peripheral revascularization procedures (surgery or angioplasty), lower limb amputations, or leg ulcers by 21 % (p = 0.0293). The proportional reduction in event rate was similar in each subgroup of patients studied, including those without coronary disease but who had cerebrovascular or peripheral artery disease, men and women, those aged either under or over 70 years at entry into the study, presence or absence of hypertension, and notably those with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/l at inclusion.</p><p>In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), the effect of therapy with Viscor on total mortality was assessed in 4,444 patients with CHD and baseline total cholesterol 212-309 mg/dL (5.5-8.0 mmol/L). In this multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with angina or a previous myocardial infarction (MI) were treated with diet, standard care, and either Viscor 20-40 mg/day (n = 2,221) or placebo (n = 2,223) for a median duration of 5.4 years. Viscor reduced the risk of death by 30 % (absolute risk reduction of 3.3 %). The risk of CHD death was reduced by 42 % (absolute risk reduction of 3.5 %). Viscor also decreased the risk of having major coronary events (CHD death plus hospital-verified and silent nonfatal MI) by 34 %. Furthermore, Viscor significantly reduced the risk of fatal plus nonfatal cerebrovascular events (stroke and transient ischemic attacks) by 28 %. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in non-cardiovascular mortality.</p><p>The Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH) evaluated the effect of treatment with Viscor 80 mg versus 20 mg (median follow-up 6.7 yrs) on major vascular events (MVEs; defined as fatal CHD, non-fatal MI, coronary revascularization procedure, non-fatal or fatal stroke, or peripheral revascularization procedure) in 12,064 patients with a history of myocardial infarction. There was no significant difference in the incidence of MVEs between the 2 groups; Viscor 20 mg (n = 1553; 25.7 %) vs. Viscor 80 mg (n = 1477; 24.5 %); RR 0.94, 95 % CI: 0.88 to 1.01. The absolute difference in LDL-C between the two groups over the course of the study was 0.35 &plusmn; 0.01 mmol/L. The safety profiles were similar between the two treatment groups except that the incidence of myopathy was approximately 1.0 % for patients on Viscor 80 mg compared with 0.02 % for patients on 20 mg. Approximately half of these myopathy cases occurred during the first year of treatment. The incidence of myopathy during each subsequent year of treatment was approximately 0.1 %.</p><p><u>Primary Hypercholesterolaemia and Combined Hyperlipidaemia</u></p><p>In studies comparing the efficacy and safety of simvastatin 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg daily in patients with hypercholesterolemia, the mean reductions of LDL-C were 30, 38, 41 and 47 %, respectively. In studies of patients with combined (mixed) hyperlipidaemia on simvastatin 40 mg and 80 mg, the median reductions in triglycerides were 28 and 33 % (placebo: 2 %), respectively, and mean increases in HDL-C were 13 and 16 % (placebo: 3 %), respectively.</p><p><u>Clinical Studies in Children and Adolescents (10-17 years of age) </u></p><p>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 175 patients (99 boys Tanner Stage II and above and 76 girls who were at least one year post-menarche) 10-17 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (heFH) were randomized to simvastatin or placebo for 24 weeks (base study). Inclusion in the study required a baseline LDL-C level between 160 and 400 mg/dL and at least one parent with an LDL-C level &gt; 189 mg/dL. The dosage of simvastatin (once daily in the evening) was 10 mg for the first 8 weeks, 20 mg for the second 8 weeks, and 40 mg thereafter.

                <p>Simvastatin is an inactive lactone which is readily hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding betahydroxyacid, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Hydrolysis takes place mainly in the liver; the rate of hydrolysis in human plasma is very slow. The pharmacokinetic properties have been evaluated in adults. Pharmacokinetic data in children and adolescents are not available.</p><p><u>Absorption </u></p><p>In man simvastatin is well absorbed and undergoes extensive hepatic first-pass extraction. The extraction in the liver is dependent on the hepatic blood flow. The liver is the primary site of action of the active form. The availability of the beta-hydroxyacid to the systemic circulation following an oral dose of simvastatin was found to be less than 5 % of the dose. Maximum plasma concentration of active inhibitors is reached approximately 1-2 hours after administration of simvastatin. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of simvastatin showed that no accumulation of medicinal product occurred after multiple dosing.</p><p><em>Distribution </em></p><p>The protein binding of simvastatin and its active metabolite is &gt; 95 %.</p><p><em>Elimination </em></p><p>Simvastatin is a substrate of CYP3A4 (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). The major metabolites of simvastatin present in human plasma are the beta-hydroxyacid and four additional active metabolites. Following an oral dose of radioactive simvastatin to man, 13 % of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine and 60 % in the faeces within 96 hours. The amount recovered in the faeces represents absorbed medicinal product equivalents excreted in bile as well as unabsorbed medicinal product. Following an intravenous injection of the beta-hydroxyacid metabolite, its half-life averaged 1.9 hours. An average of only 0.3 % of the IV dose was excreted in urine as inhibitors</p>
